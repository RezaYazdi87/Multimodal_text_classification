1,10,"I have owned two Rand McNally GPS devices over the last two years. Buyer beware! They are pieces of junk. The software is great, but the hardware does not last. The first GPS lasted a year. I spent another $400, that one lasted about 14 months. If you don't mind spending $400 a year for a GPS buy one. Otherwise do not buy it it is the worst and most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought. I still use my original GARMIN I purchased in 2006.",Piece of Junk,2
2,25,"I've had this for about 6 months now. This is the worst GPS I've owned out of 4. It very seldom picks the best, or shortest route. It will let you put in multiple stops, but you only get info to the NEXT one. If you don't like a route and put in a VIA, guess what you only get info to the new VIA, how am I supposed to know if the new route is better? Routing is unbelievably slow, I've had it take up to 30 minutes, then get it wrong. Adding things to the notes just puts it into one long line. How about putting a return so I can at least organize a little bit. Very cumbersome to use, it's of little or no use for long range trip planning. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody at any price.",VERY poor GPS,"2,3"

7,76,This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,This works great but read the details...,"1,4"

9,80,"I barely touched my Tablet until I got screen protectors because I was terrified I would completely wreck the screen since, screens seem to be allergic to me. I bought this type (anti glare) for the same price as non anti glare, & I went to B&N where the nice NOOK staff put mine on for me. So far no scratches & its doing great protecting my screen! My only complaint, why I rate this as 4 stars, is that I have to clean the screen even with the cover fairly frequently because its beyond easy to leave finger smudges all over it even with clean hands. I dont mind though. If im too lazy to clean the screen I just place my hand flat on it & run my hand across evenly so that everything turns into one big smudge that I can see fine through :P. I definitely recommend this product.",Does it's job...,1

28,393,"I have a 42&#34; Hannspree LCD TV. It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV.

35,499,Does what it's intended for below pricing found on other brands. I have a 32\ mo nted in the bedroom with this. Seems sturdy emough for it...went up easily. Only reason for docking one star is the difficulty in adjusting the unit in the beginning. You really need (on my unit at least) to work it for a while before installing so you don't have to put so much stress on the mounts once installed. It was VERY stiff and took quite a bit of muscle to loosen it up enough to adjust...even with the adjusters loosened for this purpose...suppose it's better to have it too tight than loose and have the tv \drift\ around.For $25.00 that I paid for a decent mount that has the range of angles...great find.,Great value,"1,4"

The bubble level (with magnet on the side) and cable are a nice addition.Had to cut 1 inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the TV, since it covered some of the inputs. Other wise very practical for my bedroom/Study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job.For the price ($25 and free shipping), its is a really good deal.

Only problem I had was screws were a little to long that went into back of tv and wouldn't completely tighten up. I ground them down a bit but a couple of small washers would have worked well also. I think it was just the brand of tv and the diameter of screw needed. Kit did come with various sizes of screws for the back of tv.,working great! still on the wall!,"1,3"
47,699,"Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.  Make sure you get help when installing.",Get a helper when installing,"1,3,4"

58,854,This was installed by two handy men - the first they had every done.  Went very well.  This mount was chosen because of the 20  inch extension.  The wall is recessed so the TV needs to come out of that hole.  The mounting plate sets above the 23\ LED TV an inch but the length of the extension makes that O.K.

64,985,"received the product and got it installed today. for the most part I am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts. the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for $1 per piece.  Once I put the bolt into the LCD TV and mount it with the plate, I found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver, which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms.  is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts?",just got it installed,"2,3"

66,996,"Having played with this for a couple of days I have to admit I'm impressed. I previously owed the 1950's DVD box set using the Bondi software as well, and this feels more refined and faster. I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.The quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.As others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read. Sure I'd like higher quality scans, but I own both the Rolling Stone and National Geographic box sets and poor quality scans are an issue for all digitized magazines. So grab it while you can, because I have a feeling this won't be on the market for that long.","Good, could have been great","1,3,4"

There are some apps I'd like for this product that I can't get yet, but I'm not overly worried about those. This does what it was paid to do! I can seamlessly go online, read books, listen to music, watch youtube, play games, and much more.

The selection of books is wonderful, as well as the selection of magazines, children's games, children's interactive books, and children's apps. Most things cost money, about .99 or more, but if you look for free books, there is a HUGE variety. I highly reccommend this e-reader to everyone and anyone who loves to read and browse the internet in one, but for apps and games, I would suggest a seperate venue such as Nitendo DS or portable gaming device, maybe even an ipod touch.",One of the greatest e-readers available!,1
94,1393,"Overall, I think the Nook tablet is a pretty good tablet.  It has a great price, the screen is good and the colors look great on it, but there are two major issues that I have with this tablet that keep it from being truly great.My first issue that I have with it is that the OS/Nook Software that it comes with is extremely limited.  I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and I was sorely disappointed to see that a lot of the apps/games that she wanted either were not available at all or had a price attached to them through the B&N; store.  These are the same games you can get for free through the Google Play store.  I was pretty mystified to say the least.My next issue, and perhaps the biggest issue I have, is their charger.  It's a proprietary charger (not your standard USB universal charger) and it SUCKS.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It's cheap/flimsy and I've had to replace it numerous times because the prong is extremely weak/fragile.  There's not even a good after-market charger that you can buy to rectify the situation.  All of the chargers that I've seen (whether it be through B&N; or after-market) are crap and it's only a matter of time before you'll have to replace them.  At $10 a pop (through B&N;), this can add up.I was able to solve the first problem by rooting the tablet to run Android and get the Google Play store, but sadly there's no fix to the 2nd problem and that problem can bleed your wallet over time.I really want to like this tablet because I feel like it's a great budget tablet, but when you look at the hidden costs (rooting + chargers) I'd almost be inclined to pay a little extra for something like a Kindle.In sum, it's not bad once you overcome the OS problem, but the charger will keep it from being great.  Perhaps the newer models addressed that, but on this model I'd advise to seek other options.",Very mixed feelings on this tablet,"3,4"

B&N replaced both my husband's defective Nooks but not without difficulty.  Customer Support seems to be in India and representatives are difficult to understand.  Help depends upon whether or not you manage to connect with a customer service rep who is knowledgeable.  WARNING: You CANNOT change an email address in your B&N account if you have an early version Nook (no idea what \early version\ really means) without first unregistering your Nook.  NOWHERE could I find this information on the B&N website and one would logically think that email address and password are part of one's account profile since that's where one manages those items.  Not true - you MUST unregister your Nook, THEN change your email address and/or password.  (Password seems to be able to be changed without unregistering/reregistering the Nook.)  I just spent over an hour on the telephone with multiple Customer Service reps, having been cut off at least once, before I was able to successfully unregister and reregister my Nook with a new email address and password, having been forced to change it to thwart a hacker.  Of course B&N thanks you for your concerns and apologies for your inconvenience but in light of the various problems we've had I'd recommend buying a Kindle.

106,1542,"Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader (WiFi only) [ Black & White]After a week and a half of playing with my new nook, and reading two novels on it, I decided to return it for a refund.  I found the reading experience much less pleasurable than a paper book.  The screen contrast is too low to read in low-light situations, the page turning mechanism is clunky, the page has an annoying way of flashing at every page turn, and the tactile experience is just not satisfying.The deciding factor, however, was the problem I had with connectivity.  The nook would not connect to wireless hotspots in several of my favorite coffee shops, and I found it impossible to transfer ebooks from my iBook.  I spoke with the experts at Barnes & Noble, who told me that the nook works better with some hotspots than others, and that yes, there can be compatibility problems with Macs.  In the end, I was reduced to using the nook to buy ebooks at my local Barnes & Noble store, where I discovered that seemingly all of the million-plus free books are OCR translations that have not been proofed.  They were so full of typos that they were virtually unreadable.In the end, I decided that the nook is really not market-ready.  I'm heading back to the library!",Too many bugs,3

121,1749,"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.","Heavy, slow, poor screen, buggy","2,3"

Frustration is mine, for today is the last day I had to return the device to its makers and hopefully have my problem solved. I waited so long because I did not realize I had so little time and I thought I had it fixed when it charged in a certain outlet. However, after excessive reading, the battery dwindled to the point where I had to plug it in agian. Now today I have had it plugged in for twelve hours, and yet my attempts to turn it on only elicit a brief message on an otherwise dark screen, saying, \Battery too low to power on. Please wait fifteen minuets and try again.\The Nook Color should only take three hours to charge, and yet it seemed to worsen each time I have had to plug it in. Sometimes I plug it in because it is 5% near empty, and yet the cable's light is green when it should be orange.I am bummed because I adore my Nook Color, and was in the climax of a terrific story when it winked out. As I can no longer return it breifly and get it fixed for free, I must buy a new charger and hope for the best.I want one that works perfectly, so If anyone has any advice to give, please do so.

Santa was kind enough to leave it under my tree and I've been loving it ever since.Here's why:-The weight of the reader is perfect and the size of the reader and the screen are proportionate to each other.-I love being able to read magazines on my NookColor for the fraction of the cost- in COLOR.-I love that my 19 month old daughter can interact with her favorite children's books both at home and on the go- in COLOR.-IMO there is no need for 3g- it serves no purpose. Once you download your media via the internet/wifi, it's there for you to access wherever you are. NookColor gets two thumbs up for this!-Being able to highlight passages, words etc and come back to them is a fantastic feature as is the ability to look up a words definition via wifi.-NookColor is user friendly and has a great interface; the screen color is clean, clear and crisp.Facebook has a NookColor page where you can go and find other NookColor users who are willing to lend you books and are interested in being lent books, so there's no need to literally know a fellow Nook owner.ALSO- someone mentioned you CANNOT use a Barnes and Noble Gift Card to purchase eBooks- THIS IS INCORRECT. All you have to do is log on to B&N.com; and add your gift card to your account. Once you do that, whatever purchases you make on your NookColor, the price comes off the GC until it is empty and then your CC is charged. Very simple.All in all, this is a great e-reader.

The responsive, bright screen, the endless customization, the ability to have some android apps to help when I just cant read anymore all quickly helped make my nook one of my favorite electronics. One charge seems to last forever even with heavy usage.  I've kept it in a purple cover I got from B&N and after approx. a year, the nook looks brand new.

There are a few minor glitches, it has a tendency to be a little unresponsive if you have too much on it and the web browser isn't so great.

Frankly we wouldn't have bought it if that was all it was. Since the Nook is built on an Android platform there are a few thousand apps to keep you busy between books. The screen colors are very crisp and the video is blu ray quality. We haven't owned either of ours long, but we haven't had to charge the battery yet. It has a very long life.Since we don't own a smartphone, the Nook is the next best thing.

It will save us a lot more than the purchase price.I'm sure we will find a lot more to do with the Nook over time. We are especially excited to use Netflix when it is released for the Nook.

I don't understand why :(- No Web Browser or RSS reader app or something like that- PDF reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has Tables, Bullets, Images and other graphic different from text.- You Can Not Delete, move or rename Files from the device User Interface, you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions... this makes you waist a lot of time.- The device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at B&N; store. You cannot have access to that partition (with or without computer) in order to delete this purchased books.- You can not export your Highlight or Notes from the books. Kindle is a step forward with this \most have\ feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness.

148,2205,"The NOOK e-book reader compares favourably with the KINDLE, as well as being cheaper.  Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK - I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.  The NOOK is lighter and more convenient to carry around than the KINDLE - my wife crocheted a nice neat carry bag for mine.  I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.  TO sum up - I am very satisfied.Kiap2012",Nook - e-book Reader,1

All I can do is download from B&N too, it's not like I can shop on Amazon which I do a lot. so, Nook is great Barnse and nobel is just OK, maybe less than OK in my book (that's a pun!)",Nook is good B&N is OK,"1,3"

It has a built in light, which is really nice. And, it is touch screen, which is awesome!The only flaw I see thus far is that you can't resize the letters. Apparently the letters are a standard size, I assume because of the size of the screen? Anyway, I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page. However, that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously.","Simple, great back light, comfortable size","1,3"

161,2340,"I didn't order my Nook from Amazon but all I can say is, that it is AMAZING! This nook is for the people who are major readers like me. I mean I can rip through 3 - 5 books depending on the length. You have to think that I don't always buy the books, I check them out with my library's Overdrive. Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit. I like to read all day, and it kind of sucks that I'm not able to read in the dark without any additional accessories. The battery life is great. I charged it on Christmas night, and the charge is still over 85%.They could have made the power button a little easier to push because I have trouble telling if i have pushed it or not. If your not the biggest reader, and you like to play gives, I recommend getting the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire, NOT THE NOOK COLOR! The nook color is supposed to be terrible at everything.I have no problems with my nook, I love it, and I am happy with it.",Great E-Reader,"1,3"

163,2362,good reader. uploads books fast. I do not do wifi on this because I have heard bad things about the updates. also has problems if hooked up to a computer will take the shelves away. I have a lot of books so this is a big bad thing for me. But still is good.,could be better,1
164,2390,"Bought this used Black Friday weekend online. it was in the same package. I have not been able to try it yet. I live out in the Country and on Satellite internet. So , I have to find WiFi hot spots first",Nice as described,1
165,2440,"I had purchased a certified Pre-owned Nook because all of the reviews I had read had been top notch. There was not anything that I had heard that was too terrible about this E-reader and I had never had a problem with the service with Barnes and Noble before. Then I turned on my Nook after having it six months and the bottom left hand corner of the screen there is just a white spot and cannot see what is beneath it and it will not move. I contacted the customer service to see if it could be fixed and they gave me instructions and said to call back within 3 and a half hours after the charging period was finished if the problem was not corrected. If it was not corrected, I could have them give me instructions to send it back, at my cost, and if they deem it their problem they will fix it or send a new one, but if it is seen as my fault, then they will ship it back, at again my cost. The money does not seem worth it for all of the hassle it has given me. The pages turn slower than the Kindle and the ink is much lighter, plus the battery life is at least half as long. My cousin has a Kindle and that is the item that I am going to go with, it seems like the best solution.",I would go with the Kindle,2
166,2446,"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all.So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!",Product is useless/Customer Service at the store is priceless,2
167,2462,"I've researched the readers for about two years.I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive. Upon that note, I have always been a huge fan of Amazon.For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try. First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades. No problem with turning the page at all,touch screen worked great. In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.The nook can connect to your computer (as does the Sony). You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.The nook also downloads without any effort wi-fi ( as does the Kindle).The nook's battery you can change at home. It also accepts a memory card, which allows you to expand your book collection.The Nook also has other advantages,but I was only wanted a reliable reader.Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package.",Home Run!,1
168,2463,I love this device. It's a very handy item to take on the go. It's easy to use and downloading titles is a snap. Definitely recommend.,Great e-reader,1
169,2473,"I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The \paper-white\ display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The \5 day battery life\ in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...",Disappointing,"2,3"
170,2489,"I'll start off by saying I don't own the nook but I've played around with it for a while along with the Kindle.  I'll say this about the Nook...the screen is immensely better than the Kindle.  Much, much easier to read and the pages \turn\ a lot faster.  It's still too slow for my tastes but I'm picky.  The touchscreen at the bottom really isn't all that useful, the Kindle interface wins on that account.  The biggest thing...don't buy this at amazon!  I don't know why they are selling it for $400 (I know, it's a third party vendor).  Best Buy has it for $250 so I'm not sure why people would buy it here.  I'd like the Nook screen with the larger Kindle size/interface...for $250 (I know, won't happen).  The whole ereader is still years away to getting to the point where I'd buy one.",Not bad at all,"1,3"
171,2496,"I've seen some negative reviews from people who purchased the Nook earlier this year (Jan/Feb), however, I just bought mine about a week ago and have had 0 problems with it.  My wife received hers as a Christmas gift and has never had a problem with it.  I upgraded immediately to firmware 1.3 (the newest version) which adds some games (yay for Sudoku!) as well as a web browser.  If you are looking for a mobile web device, stick to a smart phone or netbook as this is not it.  That's not a complaint as I never expected this to be a web browser for me, it's first and foremost an e-book reader, and it's a great one at that!The e-ink screen is amazing, and makes reading so much easier than an LCD screen (if you have to read a lot of PDFs for work I would buy one of these just for that!).  The other features on this are outstanding as well.  It reads a number of formats including epub and PDF, so you are not stuck only shopping for books from one source (i.e. the Kindle, iPad, and Sony e-reader).  It is also compatible with Adobe Digital Editions, so it's a snap to download a book from my local library and read it on my Nook.  It's also easy to lend books to other Nook users (so long as the book you have is LendMe(TM) compatible).  The media player works well, but only plays MP3s, so none of the songs you bought off of iTunes that is an M4P (i.e. DRM'd beyond use) will work - that's why I always recommend buying digital music from Amazon's MP3 store - great selection and prices, and NO DRM.  The sound quality from the speakers on the Nook is not so good (they're small and I didn't expect them to be top quality), but if you plug in some headphones it sounds great!I also like that it comes with three free books already pre-loaded (Dracula, Little Women, and Pride & Prejudice) and you can customize your background/screen saver with BMP, JPG, etc. pictures.  The only downside is that the battery life is not quite up to par with some of the other e-book readers out there.  A lot of that is due to the LCD touchscreen, but it's worth the hit to the battery life.  That being said, I have had no complaints with the battery life for my day-to-day usage and if you are a heavy user, you can buy a back-up/secondary battery to swap out (try that with your iPad!).  As the title says, I love my Nook, and it seems like Barnes & Noble has gotten the bugs fixed.  You can also take your Nook into Barnes & Noble and they'll go over all of the features and show you how to get the most out of it - not to mention you can read any e-book they have for free while in the store, and they are currently in a 5 week promotion where they are giving away 1 e-book each week to anyone who brings their Nook into the store.",Love My Nook!,1

175,2534,I thought you should know why I chose the Nook over Kindle.  It wasn't the music addition or the photo addition options to the unit.  I love to read and have belonged to Doubleday Large Print book club for years.  The price of the books range from 20.95 to 19.95 most of the time. I can buy two to three books and at times have change left over.  As one of the Boomers I was looking for a way to keep my hobby of reading lots of titles on a retirement income.  The Nook was the perfect answer.  The Nook offered three advantages over the Kindle.  1.  I don't have to send it in to replace the battery.  May seem like this is not a big deal to some but like most personal hand held or computers its personal.  2.  The share books feature.  I have a sister who has MS and a really limited income to be able to share books with her is a blessing. 3.  I can expand the memory a very big deal.Its simple to operate and I can read more books for less money.,Why I bought the Nook,1

177,2555,"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.  You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook, iPhone, a PC and a Mac.",Nook is the best e-reader yet,1

The only thing I'm not crazy about is that it doesn't close with an elastic or a latch like the cover on my other reader.

I was nicely surprised that the cover has some magnets inside at the bottom part (that are not visible in no way) so it shuts tight against the LCD when closed and hold quite well. The cover is not too bulky although it naturally adds some weight to your Nook because of the 2 AA batteries. On the inside it has a nice microfiber material which is of not too light color and it has a small &#34;n&#34; punched at the bottom left and decorated with a delicate glossy blue stripe - a nice touch of design.",Reasonable product if you get it for a reasonable price,"1,3"

I could hear the HD trying to spin up, but not reading properly.  If you have that indication, all you need is this HD!The repair was easy.  Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in \backwards\.  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.

When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the \DVD\ format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.  The DVD capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what I can tell (though it might just be my video card doing it)  Still, it's a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned DVDs of videos.",Cheap and it works,1
245,3491,"I have no complaints about the product itself.  It works and does exactly what it promised to do.  My purpose in writing this review is to warn parents purchasing this product for their child or teenager's cell phone that there is very adult material contained on the CD.There are three compressed files of photographs that, when extracted, create general folders then subfolders specifically labeled and containing various types of photos.  The photos range from innocuous cartoons to explicit nude shots, and the nude shots are not all contained in appropriately labeled folders, they're all over the place.I also have questions about where all the content came from and whether or not the manufacturer of this product has the rights to all those images.  As a photographer who posts her work on the Internet, I think about such things.If you're an adult and don't mind having, even temporarily as you extract the files, a collection of adult photos on your computer, then this product does what it claims to do.  It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition, and I have no complaints about its functionality.My rating of 4 is because of having to delete most of the content from the CD after having to extract it all, rather than being able to cherry-pick from a CD and only download what I wanted.

I usually plug them in through an M-Audio Fast Track (a DAC in this case) connected to my laptop, and I do notice a substantial difference between the sound quality I get with and without the DAC.  You don't have to be an audio prick to use these.  Your MP3's will sound better, but you ought to start getting your music in less compressed formats.  You will notice the difference. I also use them outside when the weather's nice.  They are great to use when I just want to veg out.  I use these to play electric guitar when I need to be quiet. Keep in mind they are very open, so everyone around you will hear what you are listening to, and you probably don't want to be \that guy.\  These are my first supra-aural headphones, but I have encountered many in school, at work, etc.  I own a pair of Shure E3C's (in ear headphones that cost twice as much,) and they don't even compare.

256,3603,"Updated: It's been a little over a month since I've had my moleskine and while I still love the case, the novelty has worn off.The outer elastic band has become stretched out to the point where it dangles a ways away from the case. It's a cosmetic issue and I'm pretty anal about the way this case looks.The straps holding the iPad have also lost some elasticity but still hold in the iPad securely with normal, daily use. I've had the case in my backpack and thrown my bag on the floor after a long stressful day, causing the iPad to slip out of one strap. However, it was an easy fix.The spine did make a crackling noise, but mine is broken in to the point where it doesn't make the noise anymore. The downside with that was when i had the case folded in (outer covers touching), a nice angle was made, perfect for typing on a desk. That angle is gone now.I haven't cut a slit to make it possible for me writing with my right hand and might not. With the spine broken in, it's easy to fold the case into a size that's not too much larger than the original ipad's dimensions. I can easily have the iPad in the case on the left side of my desk and a spiral bound notebook on my left with enough space to comfortably write.With the elastic not as strong as it once was, I rated the case lower, but I still love it. But I still wish they would come out with an official moleskine case for the iPad.For the last 2 months, I've been searching for a case for my iPad that doesn't make my new purchase look tacky.  I bought the Incase Book Jacket and didn't like the inside leather trim and returned it the next day. I couldn't wait for Moleskine to release an official iPad cover, so I bought the Moleskine Kindle DX Cover thinking that the iPad would fit due to similar dimensions. While the straps are a tight fit, the iPad does fit inside beautifully and doesn't seem like it will be slipping out anytime soon. The top right strap does cover the power button, but its easy to push down on the elastic strap to get to the button for wake/sleep/power. The volume rocker and orientation lock are in no way covered by the strap as well, allowing for easy access. Apple headphones easily fit behind the top left strap, but headphones with an \L\ shaped plug would probably fit behind the strap more nicely. The bottom left strap covers just one of the 3 speakers but it in no way hinders the sound quality.The only complaint I have is that every time I open the cover, the pages of the paper notebook fan out, but its a problem that can easily be solved with a rubber band.I'm right-handed and the paper does get in the way, but I may cut a small slit on the opposite side of the notebook holder to be able to turn the case around and make it more comfortable for me to use.Could you DIY a moleskine case for the iPad? Sure. Could you wait for an official Moleskine cover for the iPad? Sure. But this definitely gets the job done now and looks beautiful inside and out.","For those wondering, it does fit the Apple iPad",1

268,3920,"I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.

These batteries will work at almost 100% capacity (flashlight brightness) up until they are done, but then die out quickly.  I have also used them in a EO Tech gun sight.

287,4084,I just got my mini mic and my Chill Pill Rapcap in the mail today.I bought both for my iPod Class 120gig for recording lectures. I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.,Identical to RapCap,1

Despite reviews that stated it didn't work because the I-pod thinks there are headphones in, we have not had that issue with any of our talking games  with the exception of the talking Angela game.  I put the mic in and rebooted the I-pod and it worked perfectly.  I thought perhaps I would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either.

My new case is a hard snap-on one that has an edge that comes right to the edge of the headphone jack. This prevented me from making a connection because the case kept the mic from being fully inserted. I discovered that this problem was easily solved, however, by grinding away some of the plastic on the mic so that it doesn't hit the case as badly. I just used a nail file to do this, and it's barely even noticeable. Overall I am very satisfied with the excellent sound quality and wonderful price!",Good sound quality; just a couple issues,"1,3"

After I received my Garmin I discovered whenever the Garmin is plugged in to the computer via the (included) USB connection, it is also charging the battery of the Garmin.  Also in order for the Garmin to receive traffic reports on the road, the unit uses the cord (also included with the Garmin in the box) plugged into cigarette lighter as an FM antenna.  The battery included with my Garmin is adequate and most of the time when you are using your Garmin it is already charging. So you do not need another power adapter, it comes in the box with two 'free' power adapters already.  There is no need for another potentially unsafe, unneeded, device.  If you did need an AC adaptor be sure it is made by Garmin, otherwise the quality is very questionable, at a minimum it should be tested for safety by UL or UL Canada.",Works but not as advertised,2

On my Nakamichi BX-300, they frequently stop during recording or playback. It's a tension problem, wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage; basically, it thinks the tape is stuck. Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. I've had no problem with other, commercially available cassettes on this deck.My advice, if you have these tapes, is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape, then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape, after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side, until I performed the above. YMMV.

The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.  After 7 years of pressing the on/off button I'm sure thousands of times, the plastic over the on/off button ate through.  The on/off button needs that plastic over it to work!!  The damn thing won't turn on/off now!!  I tried turning the volume down to zero to \turn it off\ but the batteries do wear out and it's annoying.So I figure that 7 years of constant usage is pretty good and I am not complaining and have even come back for more!In spite of the 7-year life, I still give this radio the highest rating.  Fair is fair, right?  Can't complain about 7 years of perfect performance, can we?  I say no.",A FABULOUS RADIO,"1,3"

468,6815,A few years ago I was travelling about 130k miles a year so I was constantly on airplanes.  I got a gift certificate as a present and used it to purchase these.  I'm glad I did not \pay\ for these.I was mostly into the ANR on flights.  Sound quality was important but having a turbine 96000 lbs of thrust 15 feet away kind of reduced this to \can I roughly hear what I'm trying to hear without blasting the volume\ as I knew removing all background noise was impossible.So how are they? They are ok but I'd rather have gotten a really good Passive NR set than these ANR headset.  I just don't think they justify the price.Pros:  1 - sufficient ANR for airplanes2 - roll up into a ballCons:  1 - brutally painful as the padding is about 3 millimeters thick2 - painful after an hour3 - lots of plastic construction so you really have to baby them4 - not able to find thicker replacement ear pads5 - painful after an hourI haven't tried the Bose standard headset.  I've used their $1000 aviation headset a few times and they were excellent for ATC but no idea how they are for music though (I didn't have an iPOD to plug into the Cirrus at the time).  I'm sure their standard headsets are excellent but also very pricey.Gerald,Painful,"1,3"
469,6816,"After having used this headphone for a little over a year it has become virtually unusable. The plastic parts started creaking very soon. What seemed to be tolerable in the beginning has become ridiculous now. It is triggered by the slightest movement of the head, the jaw or even by taking a deep breath and sounds like an old ski-boot right on your ear.The shells do not encompass the ears but rather sit on the outer rim of the earlobes. And no, I don't have extremely big ears. That's simply how this headset was designed. Watching an entire film on a plane leaves you with hurting ears. The noise reduction is very good but I'd rather go nuts from the engine noise than wear the Sony MDR-NC20 for the duration of a transatlantic flight.The sound quality with noise canceling switched off is feeble and thin. However with the noise canceling on very satisfactory.Update: Now the cable has come apart and one side of the headphones has gone mute. After careful usage for a little over one year the MDR-NC20 is officially broken. I really wanted to love this thing and I treated it with more careful respect than anyone who actually takes their headphones on the road all the time.

I've never been able to sleep on aircraft and lately, my tolerance for noise and screaming kids has gone to near zero. Well, that's what the Sony MDRNC-20 noise cancelling headphones have given me, ..... nearly zero noise on flights. My last two flights (this week) were on two SAAB TurboProp commuter aircraft and two A-320's and I could not hear the engines with these headphones on. I also use a Sony R70 MiniDisk Recorder / Player that was useless, due to in cabin noise, until I bought these headsets. I've tried the Bose (overpriced and cumbersome), Sennheiser and Toshiba units and the Sony's are the best. I highly recommend them for frequent fliers if you want to be able to function at the destination end of the flight. OH! Did I mention that we also use them while cutting grass on our diesel Kubota tractor with 60 inch mower deck and can't hear the tractor noise, but Bon Jovi comes through lound and clear from the Sony CD Walkman. The audio connection cord also has a convenient connector in it so your can disconnect the main lead and just use the headphones for noise reduction. I thought this a very convenient feature for those who want to block out TV noise, kids, neighbors, etc and not listen to music at the same time.It might sound like I'm a Sony fan (which I am) but I'm also an audio engineer and my motto is \Specs first, price second\.

471,6820,"I bought these headphones when i was Japan, and have been nothing but pleased. Some things to note:1)They're made of plastic- I expected something better.On the other hand, they fold up into a neat little ball,so they are more breakage resistant that you might expect.Also, the design is great since the noise cancelling equipment is contained within the headphones,not in a clunky external box like other, less styling models (^_^)v Very very sleek and sexy.2)Those of you planning to use these with an MD player/etc. w/ an inline remote should note that while the headphones have a \short cord\the plug is actually a stupidly useless *proprietary* sony design-and the included 1/8th adaptor cord is *very* long; that is to say,you'll end up w/ tons of excess wire you don't know what to do with.There is a short Sony minijack-to-1/8th adaptor which works great,however,I've never seen it sold outside of Japan.I am incredibly happy with these headphones.However,as others have mentioned the sound is so-so.These are perfect for use with MD/MP3 or other compressed sound formats in noisy settings, but not so great for precise listening.But turning on the noise cancelling greatly improves the sound quality and I find that these headphones are more than adequate for all of my needs-combine this with the fantastic design,the awesome noise cancelling ability,a great-bang-for-your-buck value (except for the plastic),and I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good noise cancelling headphone.","Fantastic Design, Great NC, but Sound is so-so",1

483,6966,"I bought the 1.8&quot; version of this set at a great discount here on Amazon.com and I am quite pleased with it.  The active matrix LCD display ads depth and contrast to the picture comparable to tube portables.  The metal stand in the back puts the set at just the perfect viewing angle for  desktop use.  The shape of the case is stylish and easy to hold when  carrying the set about.  The jacks for AV input, Ext. Antenna, and earphone  mean this set can be connected to just about anything but it is best used  as a battery powered carry around portable.This set has only two notable  flaws.  First, the color, while quite vivid, tends to be slightly green.  Second, the tuning circuit could do with an additional RF amplifier stage  to overcome the slightly snowy reception on all but the strongest channels.  The tuner is a little slow to start scanning when the set is switched on  or when changing from VHF to UHF and it easily passes over some stations  requiring you to back up the tuning bar to lock onto the channel.  Once  tuned in, the signal quality is consistent.  I hope in subsequent versions  of this set RCA decides to upgrade the tuning circuits and set the hue more  accurately or porvide a customer control for color.On the whole this is  a good product that should provide many years of dependable service if you  don't mind the temperamental tuner.

I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with \D\ batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a \DX Machine\ both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.Although not quite as good as its predecessor the SuperRadioII, it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of AM and FM without any bells or whistles to get in the way.If you can find it discounted, then pick one up and listen away.

I had hopes for this model (mine is branded GE, but it's the same as the RCA version), but it has been rather disappointing.  This is a good radio for listening to local news and other talk radio, and it puts out substantial if not refined sound for listening to music on FM, so it's particularly good for when I'm working outdoors or in the garage.  Unfortunately, it's not easy to tune distant AM stations precisely, and the unilluminated tuning display is difficult to read in dim light.  Battery life with this radio seems to be very good, one of the best features of this model.  It also seems to be fairly sturdy, having survived a 3 ft. fall to the floor.  When it comes to AM radio reception, there are probably a few better models on the market--at least I hope there are--but they will probably cost more.

The FM sensitivity was great as I could pick up weaker stations from Cookeville and Livingston, Tennesssee from my house in Murfreesboro (80 to 95 miles). The same could be said in the other direction Huntsville Alabama and Chattanooga. On AM, I received Louisville, KY and Memphis, Tennessee in the daytime (200+ miles) and Cincinnati, Chicago, Des Moines, Detroit, and New York City by night. Sound quality was VERY GOOD and tuning was generally accurate for an analog dial.Earlier in 2004, I bought a second one. (...)  No substantial changes from appearance or sound performance are noted.  However, tuning distant stations seems a bit more difficult with the newer radio.  Also, tuning contains more inaccuracies on AM.  Furthermore, plastic knobs seem more flimsy which means they must be treated with extra care to avoid breakage and premature wear.Both radios are manufactured in China, so it is possible they may have come from the same factory. My eleven year old GE Superadio III, in my judgment, has the better overall quality.Verdict: if a no-frills radio (e.g. no dial light, digital presets, or shortwave) is what you desire, look no further. It is the best value around and produces excellent sound. If one is particular about dial tuning and cabinet durability, examine carefully and buy from a store that has a good return policy as an exchange may be required to get a accurate tuning dial.  If a high end radio is what you desire and need, consider a CC Radio or a Bose Wave Radio (about $169 and $349, respectively) over the Superadio III.","A good overall value, but be careful which batch you get.","1,3"

At home I constantly listen to NPR talk radio and so have five of these suckers. Two for the bathrooms, one for the bedroom, one for the garage, and one for gardening/yardwork. At the price, what the hell!Bought my first one twenty years ago for truck camping in NE Canada. Since, have camped in the way-out reception areas of most of the USA and a fair piece of Canada. When it's just you and the  Poodle dog (and a couple of sixers), camping out at midnight on some godforsaken' 4-WD logging road in the mountains, it can feel spooky lonely and you want to hear another human's voice...this is the ticket.Why's it so got such amazing reception? It's sophisticated circuitry was developed back when there weren't nearly as many broadcasters as now, and consumer's (many being quite rural) wouldn't buy a piece of scheiss as they nowadays do.Why's it so cheap for it's performance? The expensive design of the electronics, albeit cheap form factor, long ago paid for themselves; now it's just stamp out the same old product without ever having to update your radio just for appearance's sake. This is the same reason why the second best portable radio, the Sony ICF 2010 AM/FM/LW/MW/SW, can be sold for such a low price (if theye're still being sold).What makes it great? The sound's really superb at low to relatively high volumes and you don't miss stereo at the short distances you'd normally listen at. Whomping woofer and tight tweeter; better to put your value upon a higher quality mono speaker system than a lesser sounding stereo setup.The six \D\ batteries seem to last forever. Plus, these mega-reception puppies are tough. My twenty year old model, area of manufacture unknown as I long ago glued 1/4\ foam all over it so I could just throw it in the back of my truck, can't be determined. Incidentally, this radio once fell seven feet from a storage shelf onto the concrete floor of my workshop; still works great, 'tho I had to find a new antenna.Don't know about these Chinese Model III's being advertised re. reliability.

504,7244,This is the second one that I have. Great for those who require long-distance reception.,Great Radio,1
505,7248,"Simply put, this radio blows away every other radio (about 10 of them) I own on the AM band. I bought the GE Superadio III because I had heard that it was good at bringing in distant radio stations. Living in NYC, this is not normally a problem, however I am a big fan of Coast To Coast AM and WABC 770 does not carry the show on Friday nights for some reason. In order to get my fix, I needed a strong radio to get the job done. I don't recall where I had heard about the Superadio, but I decided to take a shot with one and ordered it. Amazon got it to me quickly, and I was quite excited when it arrived. My first impressions were about the size, and weight of the radio. The thing is big, and with batteries, quite heavy for a portable radio. The styling also screams 1980's, but that's ok. This machine was not made for looks, it was made for reception. After powering it up at the office for the first time, I decided to check it out against my two office radios. The problem at work is that we get very poor reception because it is a steel and brick building with no windows by the office area. Neither of our other two office radios could effectively pick up WABC, but the GE picked it up with no problem at all, crystal clear. The real test came up on the first friday night, it was time for coast to coast and I located a station in North Carolina at (I think) 1100 AM. Sounded as if it were next door. The radio had no problem picking the station out from between two strong NYC stations located nearby on the dial.To sum it up, I've been astounded at the reception I get with this radio. Currently, I can easily scan the dial and pick up half the country it seems. Also, based on other comments, I appear to have gotten lucky with a pretty accurate dial.My only complaint is that the battery case is rather flimsy and it doesn't take much to pop the door off.If you're thinking about investing in a great AM radio, then this is the one! It really doesn't need an external antenna in my opinion, but consider this. If you're looking for the ultimate in AM reception and your torn between the Superadio and CCradioplus. You can get the Superadio and one hell of an external antenna together for less than the CCradioplus.","A super, superadio",1
506,7276,"I am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of AM and FM receiving.  It's all true.  But quality of product is just horrible.  Look, I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I haven't seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios.  Quality or a lack of it is just appalling.  The tuning knob will fell off very soon.  There's no soft material under battery door-so battery rattle (I put some paper inside it cured rattle).  I understand this product made in China, but look you can buy Sony, Grundig, or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China, as a matter of fact, almost everything nowdays made in China.  It's not a question whether or not something made in China it's a matter how good it made there.  This radio is obviously was made in garage in China.  Just tell me why, but why there's no light on tuning scale, how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb.  GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.  I wouldn't ever buy this product for looks.  It looks awful, but reception on AM is excellent, yes it is.",Performance is excellent-quality of product is awful,"2,3"

For one year, it doesn't pay, but for a 2-YR contract, it pays itself off after the first year.

I know this from experience(the modulation of the telephone signal into a radio signal is the source of the quality loss).

I thought it had something to do with the range, but after playing with it for an hour or so, I discovered that this device *needs* to be plugged directly into your wall jacks to work as intended.

The manual that is included makes it very easy to learn to use all of the features, and also explains how to use the more complicated features of the GPS.There are several things that make this GPS very handy.  the 12-channel receiver is great for getting a very accurate reading when you are in a vehicle, or under dense tree cover.  There are 9 navigation screens that are quite useful, but, I find myself using the position, compass, and plot screens most.There are two things that would make this GPS perfect.  The first would be waterproofing.  It would be nice if you could take it out in the boat, and not have to worry if it slipped out or your hand, or got soaked by a large wave.  The other thing that would be nice, is a built in electronic compass; but you can carry a compass along easily enough.All in all, a great GPS for a hike through the woods, or a ride in the boat.

The fit around the ears was nowhere near as nice as the previous pair I had, and there seemed to be an intermittent (more on than off) constant tone around 9000 hz that was quite irritating.Save yourself the time and aggravation with this pair, spend the money on a nice Audio-Technica unit (like I'm going to do) and get something that meets your needs for the long haul.",Not worth your time,2

The noise cancellation is adequate (I have used them on an airplane and in other noisy environments and they manage to cancel out almost all of the environmental noise, and they are also manufactured in such a way that the band between the headphones has somewhat of a forward lean so that you xcan recline in your airplane seat and not be resting against the headphone band). However, having owned these headphones for almost 2 years, I had to replace them several times. This was precipitated by one side of the headphones suddenly not transmitting sound, so I would only be getting sound to my right ear and not my left. This might have been caused by the somewhat bulky battery case that is inline with the headphone wire itself and puts some strain on the wire whenever you wind up the cord to put them away. Luckily, Wal-Mart carried these for a number of years, so I was able to keep exchanging them whenever they ceased functioning properly. Overall, if you have $40 to spend and you're not planning on having these be your lifelong headphones, they are a good buy, and you won't be disappointed with the sound quality.",Mixed Review,1

IF you have a small head, these headphones make you look like idiot because they are exceptionally big, and look weird, kind of like some alien communication device.Overall though there is nothing extremely bad about these headphones and they will suit mostly everyone who buys them, and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound.",Jensen,1
578,8078,"The Acoustic Research HT181 Optical Digital Cable is a wonderful choice if you are looking to take your stereo system to the next level.As I've come to notice, it seem that the only cables out there where the Monster cables. Not true. The great news is, for a cheaper price and without sacrificing quality, the Acoustic Research cable is the perfect match for those of us who are watching our money and want a good quality product.If you have a DVD player (mines an RCA...) that has an optical audio plug and a stereo receiver that receives optical audio, don't wait any longer!! Stop using those RCA left and right plugs and buy an optical cable.The AR HT181 cables will expand you're listening please due to the fact that every speaker in your system (front: left/right,  back: left/right, Center & subwofer) will receive it's own independent audio signal creating incredible audio effect and enhance your listening pleasure to any DVD movie.To try and be super technical about these cables and compare them to Monsters is overkill and every room has it's own unique acoustics. The point being . . . if you're looking for a digital optical cable and are looking for a good price these should be an excellent choice.The construction of the cables are good.

581,8103,I bought the Advent AW770 for pickup at Circuit City as a Christmas gift for my mom.  She installed it for TV listening and discovered that it would not change channels.  After many tuning attempts by herself and with the help of neighbors she called Advent for assistance and they insisted their equipment was not the problem and were rude to her.  She took the unit to Circuit City and they plugged it in and had the same problem.  She called Advent back to talk to a supervisor who was more insulting than the first guy.She now has a Sony MDR RF975RK.,Fugetaboutit!,2
582,8104,I love my Advent Wireless stereo headphones.  I have 3 and have used them for several years.  The only complaint is that the ear pads have worn out and I cannot find new ones.  I was able to before the company was bought out.  The only reception problem I ever have is when I leave one particular cordless phone off the base.  I get a periodic beeping.  Return the phone to the base and the beeping stops.  I have a studio separate from my house.  I can listen clearly in the studio from a tv playing next door.  Buy one today!,Great Reception!,1
583,8132,"The features are great: the machine beeps when you have a call waiting  alert (to replace the traditional &quot;beep&quot; tone that Call Waiting  made that Caller ID takes away), it flashes a light when you have a new  call so that when you get home you can see immediately if you have received  any new calls, and the display is nice and large. The unit itself is very  easy to use.However, my unit always indicates that I have a  &quot;beep&quot; (Call Waiting) but there isn't any! At least once every 15  minutes per call it does this. It is extremely annoying. It has gotten to  the point where I don't even check for other calls anymore because I have a  feeling it's just the machine malfunctioning.I should have listened to  the other two reviewers who gave negative reviews.

It has the absolute worst sensitivity and only quietly beeps (at its loudest volume) when a police car is about 50 feet in  front of your vehicle.  I always see the cop before the detector begins to  beep.  Ka band sensitivity is even worse!  With this band, it beeps only  once as you are passing the cop, and not before. This is no joke.  I took  my first ESD 6700 back to the store because I thought that it was  defective, but the second one was just as bad.  As the signal gets  stronger, the beep frequency does not increase, it only beeps about three  times for about three seconds very slowly until you pass the threat.

587,8151,"This is a nice product.  It has many good features and given it were a little better put together it would be a perfect product.The problems I found with the product are as follows:1) The VOX is useful but doesn't always work as one would hope.  It has a tendency to pick up every little sound and if you turn down the sensitivity then the VOX won't pick up every word so you have choppy transmissions.  Examples Too High : &quot;(air from walking, breathing) Hey this is so-and-so and I am back at camp. (more air from walking, breathing) BLEEP(end of transmission signal) (more breathing and air)&quot; Too Low : &quot;This BLEEP so-and-so BLEEP camp BLEEP&quot; It might be possible to find a perfect setting, but I sure haven't found it yet and I have been playing around with them.2) The PTT button is kind of sensitive.  When I use the PTT (which is always since VOX would pick up any and every paintball shot) the button is very similar to the buttons on my FRS-100 because they have to be pushed hard and right in the center.  Press any bit off of the center of the button and you will get choppy transmission similar to the ones in the VOX example.Don't get me wrong, they are kinda nice and if you are willing to put up with the PTT button and the VOX, they are wonderful....",Nice but far from perfect,1

When I purchased the power strip it came with a Lifetime Warranty. I contacted Belkin to use the warranty - the Belkin responsevia email, was that what they gave me was a LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANY and that since they are no longer producing this power strip they will not honor their warranty. They sent me a link to purchase another one. So I called their Customer Care Dept. at 800-223-5546, and they told me that the Limited Lifetime Warranty is only good while they are producing the product and after that they don't support or replace the defective product.

We had a concern regarding battery life  and found by the end of the week we still had two of three bars remaining  on the battery status indicator, this was after having the radios on all  day, plus some occasional use around the village. We used Duracell Ultras  since they were recently tested by our local TV station to actually last  longer. We also didn't know what to expect with reception in and around the  mountains.

The sound is always clear, the bass does not drown out the treble as is the case with some Sony models.  This model does not  have the UTOC error exhibited by the 702 and by some other earlier models.  Moreover, recording is very easy.  I don't have a digital output device  available, so I use analog recording.  I can take a line direct from the  sound card of my PC to record my mp3 collection on MiniDisc.  This  convenience is heightened by the fact that this unet will not skip under  most normal circumstances.  I find that for use in the car or while  jogging, it will not skip.  The sound is perfectly clear (much better than  the Sony, Panasonic, or Aiwa models I tested at Circuit City.)  I highly  recommend the MD-MS722.

While some higher models have the auto-level, which sets the recording level to the correct setting even if the input changes this model does not have one. I would perfer the auto-level control, but from my experience adjusting the level manual is sometimes easier (in a dj mixing enviroment as a example). Another great feature is the &quot;jog-dial&quot; which makes typeing out a MiniDisc name very fast, and easy. While this is my first MiniDisc recorder, I have no complants and find this format will be my choice for all recordings, analog or digital.As a note to record your cd, just record with the &quot;sync&quot; option on. This will start, stop recording and even change tracks to match the cd. Some cd's will have problems, like a mix cd that has no end to each of the tracks. Another nice feature is the digital in, when recording from a digital source (DVD, CD player) you can get very clear sound, and easy recording set-up.The only problem I find with this recorder is, 1- the lack of a backlit screen on the main player(it does have a backlit remote). It's not a major problem, just nice to see more details than the remote shows while in a dark room. Something to point out is that this recorder uses a &quot;slot&quot; ejecting style or the common &quot;clam-shell&quot; design. Some people like this, and some don't. Personally I like the slot style more since it give the recorder a less fragile feel. Overall the recorder is very well built, using metal for the main body and after playing MiniDiscs I doubt I will go to tapes or cd for my personal listening.If you don't have a home recorder, or need to make some high quality recording try this recorder. One last thing to remember is that after making a recording, you must not move the recorder while it is making the &quot;TOC&quot; table or contents file. This will cause you to get a bad recording.",great value,1

The camera I purchased came with an artistic condition called &quot;Light leak&quot;, which puts a beautiful white arc on some of the pictures.  It also takes very, very blue pictures.  The shots look great on an island, but not in the snow.  My boyfriend used this camera and I used my own Nikon to take the same shots, and his were much bluer. We both used Kodak film and got it developed at the same place. I also agree with the flimsy comment down below, and I don't understand how Olympus can claim this is a water resistant camera, if light is getting through to the film it can't be air-tight.  Despite the drawbacks, it is the smallest and lightest 35mm camera I have ever seen.  The slide-across lens cover is great, b/c it means you don't need a case for the camera.

689,9503,"Okay, I bought this case with my Palm V in fall of 1999. Loved it then, love it now. The pockets hold all kinds of stuff, and with the simple tab/loop closure it is quite expandable. The case has worn very well, acheiving a kind of supple patina with constant carrying and shoving it in and out of coat pockets. Stylish and slim, just like the descriptor says.However, I tend to drop my Palm V all the time. Well, at least once a week anyway, and for a year, that was okay. The case protected it and all was good. Then one day I dropped it on a tile department store floor, and the popping sound it made on contact was decidedly different. Sure enough, I had spider-webbed the screen with fissures and all was lost.Then I replaced the unit and kept the case, only to have it happen again (this time on hardwood floors in my home). Okay, I'm a klutz, what can I tell you? But again the case was not protection enough. In the first bad incident, my Palm landed on a corner and in the second it landed on its face (IN the case). this time the damage was not as severe, but the screen was basically shot.Again I repaired/replaced the unit and now, hundreds of dollars in damage after my purchase of the Palm V, I live in constant fear of tile and wood floors and parking lots everywhere. I am searching for a new, more durable case, but one with the same look and feel (no zippers!) just isn't out there. So buy this case, but be warned. You'll need to be careful.","Terrific, but really not protective",1
690,9504,"Unlike my other reviews which usually take up a page or so, this product is rather straight forward.  First and foremost I must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case, which is also manufactured by  3Com, in both form and function.  Second it can hold credit cards and money  to be used as a second wallet, although it is not a great idea to use it as  a primary substitute.  And thirdly, the hard case is about ten dollars more  than the leather case and is not nearly as good.However, like all  things, it does have it's downsides.  It's biggest flaw, like with other  cases, is that it makes placing the Palm in the craddle (while still in the  case) a little more difficult.  You basically need to place the craddle up  on something (upside-down cup for example) and pull back both sides of the  case all the way and then you can recharge.  Secondly, the pockets are made  so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards  into or out of the pockets, which is why you might want to stick to a  regular wallet.  And thirdly, if you place the cased palm in a tight space  like a bag or something, there is a chance that the edge of the case will  hit the power button and cause it to turn on.  This is not a big deal since  it will shut off automatically after a minute or so, however it can become  annoying when you haven't charged your palm in a while and you find that  your battery is dying for some strange reason.All in all, you can't do  much better than this case for only $19.95, and while there may be more  expensive cases on the market, they are all variations of this simple  design.  However, I would say that it would be nice it 3Com or Palm would  make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection  on all sides, since something can get caught between your palm and the case  and end up scratching the screen (which almost happened to me).Final  thoughts: nice leather, don't expect it to take the same beating as the  hard case, but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm, don't shovel  out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case, get this nice leather one  instead.Revuman:  Stay Tuned for more Reviews...peace!","Nice case, OK wallet, better than the hard case","1,3"

693,9590,"I've had these speakers for about 6 months now and I am extremely suprised at the great sound quality from them.  It does lack some in the bass.  It only hits 80Htz.  But they still sound great.  I was using a reciever with the bass boost centered at 45 htz.  How useful on speakers that won't hit that low!  But I got a good pioneer that's centered at 100htz, and they sound way better.  Very clear sound no matter how loud they are.  Tweeter sounds good, but there is some whine in the higher bass, but for running them to the max what do you expect?  I'm running 100 watts per channel through these, and they'll handle it very well, especially for the size.  I did blow one of the woofers last week from having them up way too high when it went from a vocal song to a bassier song, but when taking the woofer out, I noticed it was a quality speaker with 60 watts max, vented pole piece, and a good magnet structure.All in all I think these speakers are comparable to way more expensive speakers in everything but deep bass.  But I have the KLH 10&quot; 120 watt sub and they are a perfect match.  Despite what people say about KLH I'm suprised with the quality of their products.  Most of the bad reviews are due to operator error.  And what do you expect from $50 bookshelfs?  Deep bass to crack a window?

For a full comparison see the foll:For a quick look at competition in its price range and relative merits:1.

Sharp CDBA 150 - Not a system for those who want an excellent remote or ease of use(it lacks auto-reverse for casettes for example) It does have an outstanding sound quality (50 watt /channel, but excellent sound fidelity)which I simply loved though. Same price as the JVC MX-J100. Downside: I did have problems with its antenna and had to get it replaced. Nevertheless for sheer outstanding sound quality I would rate this the best anyday at its $150 price5. Sony CFD Z550 - Sony reliability, ease of use. Downside : There's no comparing the sound quality. This one is way down and would compare with lower grade systems from the Sharp stable actually for its $150.6. Sharp CDC 3900 - 300 watts of power!

Could save someone money and frustration.I ordered this Defcon 1 unit (~$34) in April 2013, and received a Devcon CL (combination lock and cable ~$21) that was improperly labled with an Amazon SKU label listed improperly as a Defcon 1 unit. It arrived in a clear plastic pack so I could see it was the wrong item. If I did not have Prime it would likely have cost me shipping. Prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund, so I was OK with this.

But, rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same Amazon seller, I opted to use something else.  Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens, but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon (I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service), so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping.

I connect it and get on with my studying. Come dinnertime, I feel it's time to go, so I put the combo in the lock and IT WON'T UNLOCK.

The Amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you! Now I'm trippin out, so I start Googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo. Luckily, engagdet.com did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these things.I drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters, and come back to cut the cable. Takes me about 10 minutes to cut through, with a 7\ wire cutter (something a person can have in their pocket while you're away from your comp, spend 10 min, and be off with your laptop in their hands). Unfortunately, during that 10 min duration, someone reports me to the librarian because they think I'm trying to steal a laptop. I have to log in to the computer to prove that it's mine. Slightly embarrassing, but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo, but was pretty easy to cut through.SO, to recap, the reasons this is the WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED:1) IT WILL RANDOMLY CHANGE THE COMBO.

709,9822,I have been using the SP III for around a year and it has worked out great.  I would agree that battery life leaves alot to be desired.  The other thing I would like to see is Macintosh support or an open development platform so others could write for the Mac.  I carry around an old laptop when on the road in my RV just to update the GPS.  It works great and gives you confidence while traveling in unknown areas.,Works pretty well,1
710,9848,"I bought this GPS a few years ago. As I work in the Army and my unit never fitted me with a military GPS, I decided to get one of my own. I was amazed then. It helped me out alot when trying to figure out my position. It's usefulness is limited in forests and in blizzards, which often is when you need the most. It was of course useless inside armored vehicles, but that's more than one can expect unless one has an external antenna.The GPS can usualy track your position within two or three minutes, which is pretty fast. However, if you keep it turned on, it will drain your four AA batteries pretty quick.I have always had the philosophy that one should NEVER solely trust a GPS. One should merely use it as a backup for a map and a compass. For this use, the Garmin GPS-12XL is just as good as you'll ever need it to be. However, the extra functions are rather primitive and probably most suited for fishers to mark their good spots.Having said all this, I must add that GARMIN has come out with several newer, better, more advanced and even cheaper GPS's. I recommend buying one of those instead. Think carefully and decide wisely.",Great... A few years ago,1
711,9864,"After recently purchasing a new Palm Vx, I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap. The Palm V hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment.The case attaches to the Palm V via the left stylus storage area. A stylus shaped piece attaches the Palm to the hinge in the case. The case itself opens like a book and allows the Palm to move much like a page in the book. Located behind the Palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper. The case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the IR port as well as the right stylus.Pros:1) Protects as advertised. The point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all, and this case delivers as advertised. The aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the Palm V tightly and securely.2) Allows for IR port usage while resting in case.3) Case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketCons:1) Heavy: One of the selling points for the Palm V series is the sleek, lightweight design. While this case may not seem like too much additional weight, the combination of the Palm V in the case is noticeably heavier. In fact my wife's Palm III and my Palm V weigh about the same now.2) Obstructive: hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself. A friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well.3) Hand holding the unit is more difficult. With the included leather flap, you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the Palm in one hand. The hard case does not fold back on itself, which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the Palm. This is especially annoying for me since I use my Palm frequently while standing or walking here and there.4) ...Overall, I think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her Palm in the smallest package. You will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers. At this time, I am still using the case, but I anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when I grow tired of the Cons listed above.Thanks for your time...",Good protection comes with a trade off,1
712,9865,"I was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first. Afterall, it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it. I no longer have doubts.I have unintentionally dropped my Palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces (brick, hard wood floor, etc.), and both the case and, more importantly, the Palm itself have come out completely unscathed.So, my advice is, if you are looking for real protection for your investment, just get one of these. There is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others (unless you are planning on using the Palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range...).Not surprisingly, the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish, too. You don't feel geeky pulling it out, and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.An excellent product.","Stronger Than One Would Think &#65533; Stylish, Too!",1

714,9894,I have read most of the reviews (good and bad)written here for the Palm hard case. I have gotten my palm pilot last week and went to Compusa to find a case.

I ended up buying IBIZ Aluminum travel hardcase.  This IBIZ hardcase is made of rugged aircraft aluminum and your palm is totally enclosed except for the part where you beam and about an inch on the side where the stylus is.  This case looks very sleek and comes in black or silver.  The best part of this product is it only costs [price]in Compusa.  I suggest you check this out before buying the palm hard case.

715,9909,"I've found the hard case to look fine, work well, and hold up to a lot of use. Lets face it, even though it's got style, the Palm is first and foremost a tool. As such, a leather case seems to defeat the purpose. Maybe  it looks good, but I've found the leather cases to be less practical than  the sturdy hard case. Most leather cases do seem occassional make contact  with the &quot;on&quot; button when the Palm is being carried in hand or  pocket. The Palm did occassional get turned on accidently in the leather  case a tried. That has never happened with the hard case.As others have  noted, a little thought should overcome any criticism leveled at the hard  case. The cradle can be adjusted to allow hot syncing without removing the  case.The hard case seems like the most practical cover for a very  practical tool.","A Good, Practical Case",1

This makes it difficult to  juggle hands with the stylus in order to get into a position to use it.  I  wish that Palm made a left-handed version!  Oh well....

You  can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize  your life and how wonderful it is. As a Palm collector (I have all Palm  and Pilot models), I will rather compare the Palm V to the  Palm Vx. The  only difference between the two is that  the V has 2MB of RAM, while  the Vx has 8.I have thousands of addresses, thousands of appointments, and  many  more to-do items, documents, etc. in my Palm. I  also have fax, e-mail,  and internet software  installed, among many other programs. I only use  about  1.5 MB. Therefore, although I have the Vx, I don't use any of the  additional memory. Technically, because of the additional  memory, the  Vx is faster. Nonetheless, because Palm  applications are so small, this  difference is truly  negligible. Therefore, before you spend $100 more on  the Vx, make sure you're going to use the additional memory. It's the  only difference.Now, remember: the V  series is rechargable, while the III series uses  AAA  batteries. Therefore, travelling with a V palm means you'll have to  carry around the cradle. If you'd rather use batteries, maybe  the IIIx is  better for you.Good luck!",Magnificent!,1

That's what makes this card good --  it's one of the lower priced cards from a respected industry  vendor.Tulip cards are known for their low CPU utilization, high  throughput and their ability to run on a variety of platforms.  I have  personally used this card with great success on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris  x86, Windows 95, 98, and NT.I did dock one star however, and that's  because their have been some minor problems with the drivers included on  the driver diskettes.  Those seem to have been fixed with subsequent  releases, and the card itself wasn't to blame.  If you do have problems,  and you can use one of the other Tulip drivers included with your OS, such  as the Digital DE500.  In fact, Windows may autodetect it as an &quot;Intel  21140 Fast Ethernet&quot; or some such.","Great performance, good variety of platforms supported",1

Overall, though, music CDs will sound quite good with this sound card and will suit the needs of most users.  All but the most intense gamers should also be happy with this card's performance.

I've seen my mom struggle trying to put film in her 35mm and that made me want to stick with disposables and it also made me apprehensive about buying a camera. Then i found out about APS and it I was like Hallelujah! It was a godsend for a klutz like me. Just drop the film in and the camera does the rest.When I first saw this camera, i couldn't believe there was a camera this small. It literally fits in the palm of my hand. I'm a big girl but it'll seem small to you too. I carry it in my purse because you never know when you'll need a picture. It hardly weighs anything so it's not a burden. It's small enough for jacket or shirt pockets.Because this was going to be my first camera and all, I wanted to get something that was reasonably priced yet didn't lack in quality. Canon being a respected brand, this was an easy choice.I have no regrets so far with this camera and i doubt I'll have any in the future. My pictures turn out great and i like the date/time imprint feature (on the back of photo). Although the Elph LT has no zoom it takes pretty good pictures.

876,11838,"I have two. I made one into a clean tissue dispenser by filling a plastic round canister with tissues from a cardboard tissue box, and slipping the plastic canister into the Case Logic bag. It is a bit of effort to refill, and then I discovered that the Kleenex Oval Expressions box fits perfectly though quite snugly. The CaseLogic bag is longer, and the Kleenex box would slip down to the bottom (away from the opening at the top), so I use a clip to roll the bottom of the CaseLogic bag up to keep the tissues at the top opening of the bag.My only complaint about the bag is about the velcro. The bag comes with a strip of velcro attached to one side, and another strip with a removable glue back that you can stick somewhere in the car to keep the bag from swinging around. I strongly dislike hook-and-loop because it catches on fine materials. The strip of velcro that is on the bag itself is the side that snags everything, so I have to keep the other matching side of velcro stuck on it.

When I purchased this radio I so wanted it to be great like the old days of Grundig . Its not bad , but I wouldn't go out of my way to reccommend it over others . The Sony sw7600gr and the Sangean ATS909 are much better buys . Here's why , first off the Grundig YB400pe is generally not made very well . The poor quality of the body , the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen . The tuner sensativity on FM is good but AM and SW are fair . The side band set up is ok , others are better . One draw back is that it takes 6 AA batteries while the others take 4 .This makes the radio very heavy for its size . True that the Sangean 909 and the Sony 7600 are a little more expensive but worth it . You are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound . So I guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good.",Average performance radio,2
879,11900,"This is an absurd piece of junk. If you intend to limit its use to light local AM and FM broadcasts or pretending you're Flash Gordon it may  suffice, as long as you have a home palatial enough to accomodate it.  However, even with a decent long wire shortwave antenna you will need  either a lot of patience or very strong stations, because tuning the clumsy  slide-style tuner is almost impossible to do with any degree of precision.  Even in an area of good radio reception this unit requires a quality  antenna for any, including the strongest, stations, especially on FM.  You  will need -- and this is not a myabe, you will will will need -- separate  antennas for FM and AM, and don't underestimate the headache this may  represent for you, not to mention the extra expense and rat's nest of wires  needed just to bring static down to acceptable levels. And you won't get  away with just a cheap FM dipole antenna: the one I tried did nothing for  this gigantic colossus, and I had to use a powered FM antenna. (I had to  try three until I finally tuned out the static on FM). The feel is mushy,  and in fact, the knobs aren't even firmly set in place -- whatever it is  that they're are attached to moves around as you rotate the knobs, as if  they didn't finish putting the thing together inside the case. It surprised  me how shabbily made this fairly cool-looking radio was when I first  started messing around with it. There are two things about this radio that  are unforgivable: NO HEADPHONE JACKS! Even as I write this I can't quite  believe it, and feel like one will appear, it will have been cleverly  hidden -- but no matter how hard I look, how much credit I give them for  ingeniously disguising the thing -- it's not there. So if you're going to  use this bedside, just remember that it will always be a group activity,  and using it to record anything is ruled out for you. This is absolutely  beyond belief, considering that a jack would have added about four cents to  the cost  of  this behemoth. Equally irritating is that the line input for  using an auxiliary sound source -- your cd walkman, say -- is absolutely  terrible. You need to turn the unit way up just to hear what you've  attached, and then it comes through sounding like a damp toilet paper and  comb kazoo. I don't know how they could have possibly failed to do this  properly, but please do not buy this device if you expect to listen to your  cd player through it. The sound will kill you. The wooden case is nicely  made, but beware, it is much bigger than you might expect, about the size  of a medium-size microwave oven, and it needs even more space than its  footprint alone would suggest, because two of the three speakers are on the  side. Bottom line -- if you really like the way it looks and you don't mind  static on most stations, if you never intend to listen to an auxilliary  player through it, if its use as a shortwave is limited to maybe BBC and  other big-output stations, AND if you both never want to use headphones or  record anything, then this might, just might, do the job. Or you could get  a real radio nd use something else for decoration.","Good Looking, Bad Engineering",2

I decided for the radio's appearance alone, it was worth the investment for someone like me who had a Grundig in my youth during the 50s and 60s.  From there, it just got better.  I ordered the 960 from barbjewels through Amazon.  I received it promptly, packaged well and in perfect condition.  I suspect that it is the first version because it has the side speakers (my suspicion is based on other reviews).  First, irrespective of performance, it IS a great conversation piece.  But, it also has terrific sound and reception qualities - - kind of that old time sound that I want to believe I remember.  I began listening to a local oldies station on FM using an internal plug-in antenna.  Perfect.  I have since plugged my XM into the auxillary jack.  Again, perfect.

It is less effective at cancelling out conversations around you.  The batteries have a long life, but when they finally wear out, you can still use these as ordinary headphones.  You do need power to get the active noise reduction.  The unit is compact, and it includes an adapter to use it with the sound system on an airliner.

It fits well in your hand, has a fast zoom  compared to my Pentax WR90, and is so convenient.I would highly  recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good quality picture at a  price that is very affordable.

912,12362,"The arrow keys take a little getting used to, but it is great on the wrists.When I first started using this keyboard it was on my computer at work.  For about the first 3 or 4 days, I had trouble with the arrow keys, and the 6 keys above the arrows (home, end, delete, page up, page down, and  insert).  The problem is that they are arranged different than any keyboard  that I have used before.  Once I was used to using this keyboard, I had a  difficult time using my keyboard at home.  Shortly thereafter I replaced my  home keyboard with this one.As far as key placement goes, the important  things to know are:1.  The placement of the backslash key.  I have seen  this in a couple different places on different keybards.  The Microsoft  Natural Keyboard Elite V2.0 has the backslash key above the enter key and  below the backspace key.  This allows for the larger backspace key.  I feel  that this is very important, since this is something that I have become  very used to.  Over the last 15 years, I have tried keyboards that have the  backslash key next the the backspace key, and I just seem to make mistakes  with that placement.  Microsoft has done this one correctly (in my humble  opinion).2. The keypad above the arrows (home, end, delete, page up,  page down, and insert) is arranged different that I have ever seen it done  before.  Usually this is a keypad that is 3 keys wide by 2 tall, Microsoft  has changed the layout to 3 tall by 2 wide.  This doesn't seem to perform  any differently than the old way, it is just different (not good or bad,  just different).  This will take a little getting used to, but it works  well once you have adapted.3.  The arrow keys.  Until this keyboard, I  have always seen the arrangement of 3 arrow keys across the bottom (left,  down, right), with one centered above those 3 (up).  This does it  differently, there are 2 keys in the middle area (left and right) with a  key centered above (up), and below (down).I seem to be able to type  faster using this keyboard than I have using other keyboards.I used the  original Microsoft natural keyboard, and it is elevated off the desk much  higher.  The older one had an option to raise the front of the keyboard,  but this one only has the option to rais the back.The lights for scroll  lock, num lock, and caps lock are located in the center of the keyboard, in  the break between the left and the right hand side of the home row.  This  is good because they are easier to notice than when the lights are in the  keys or next above the number lock.I use this keyboard on both windows  and unix, and it works great.I am not someone who has had problems  with my wrists, but I do notice that it is just more comfortable.If you  spend much time at they keyboard, I would recommend this keyboard.","A great keyboard, but it takes a little getting used to.","1,3"

932,12580,"I bought these babies the same day that i bought my Vx. I thought that it would have been a good investment counsidering how small the styli are. Considering my penchant for misplacing things, particularly pens, i thought i should go ahead and get them. For some strange reason, I've only lost one in 6 months and that was the one that came with the unit. In that aspect one pack of these replacement stylus should last you a while.However if you can get other replacement styli that can fit the silo i suggest you go that way. The replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one. It doesnt fit right. After a little investigation i found that the plastic tip (the part that can unscrew) is slightly larger in circumference then the original stylus. Thats why it seems a little tight when you take the it out and put it back. Why this is, i have no clue but it's really annoying.For anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit, otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silo.Personally though i dont use the stylus. I recommend you go get one of those multi-pens that have a stylus, pen and pencil all in one. All serious Palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps, at the very least. Its like writing with a toothpick. If you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen. Cross makes a good one, Lamy and Rotring also makes excellent multipens. Personally i use a Rotring black matte Trio-pen. It carries a blue pen, stylus and pencil. Its a great size, weight and looks incredibly cool.Again if you anticipate scribling alot on your palm, i strongly recommend getting a multi-pen.

I chose this card largely based on a value model measuring 3D frames-per-second per dollar. This seems like a good way to sidestep the religious nature that the 3D card debate has  taken.My other considerations were software compatibility, screen image  appearance in 3D, and 2D performance superior to my previous 2D card. With  early drivers from 3dfx, the Voodoo3's 2D performance was reported to be a  weaker point of this card, but with drivers available now I see a  noticeable 2D boost over my machine's stock 2D card, the IMS/ixMicro Twin  Turbo 128 8MA. My whole system is more responsive and actually seems more  stable. And, yes, all my 3D games are gorgeous and fluid under this card at  any resolution I please. (Note: I have yet to test Q3A.) Naturally, I'm  using the card on a platform that 3dfx doesn't even support or warrant...at  least not ``officially''.If you buy this card for a Macintosh, this is  an important thing to know. While my own experience has been fun,  considering the product wasn't even packaged or intended for my platform,  I'd buy from a retailer with a liberal return policy, just in case you were  to run into difficulty with, say, flashing the card's ROM (which ships for  Windows/PC use) with the ROM image that 3dfx supplies on the net for Macs.  Not to worry otherwise, 3dfx has done a bang-up job of (not?) supporting  the Mac. Mac driver updates show up at 3dfxgamers.com every week or two.3dfx is apparently considering whether to support the Mac only through  other board makers as in the past, or to finally go directly to Mac  consumers with their brand.",Excellent bargain in 3D/2D acceleration,1

Three months later I couldn't ignore the lip sync problem any longer and took it back to the fine people at Circuit City who had it fixed for me 2 weeks later.  It has worked flawlessly ever since...until a few months ago.  Some rented DVDs no longer played right.  My wife and I would have to constantly rewind and fast forward through to try to finish the movie.  The discs would be cleaned, but nothing.  The player would be cleaned, performance seemed to improve, but nothing.  New discs still worked fine.  Then it happened.

957,12849,"This a good fast P+S zoom camera in many situations. It does have AF/AE lock, which is almost the only form of real exposure control it has. There are some other nice options though, including fill flash, infinity lock (landscape), macro/closeup, continuous shooting, flash off, night scene, redeye off/on. The zoom is fast and not too loud, it starts up quickly, recharges the flash moderately quickly, has a pretty fast (f3.5 on the 28mm end), sharp and CONTRASTY lens for this type of 35mm camera. I've gotten some beautiful images from it already (bought it used at Amazon a few weeks ago)with little effort, partially due to having the wide sharp lens and partially due to the ease of use and good center-weighted metering. It'd be nice if it went to 85mm or so, but then it would probably have to be a little more complex, slower, and heavier, so why burden the design? The lens is a little distorted (pincushion) on the edges at 28mm, so watch that when photographing buildings. Also remember that it'll always default to flash ON mode after restarting, though it maintains the flash OFF mode while on if you set it that way.I prefer flash OFF most of the time, so I wish it had a Personal settings mode like the Canon z90w and Sure Shot 120, but that's NOT in the package..","Not much manual override, but pretty good anyway..contrasty lens",1

Though the  manual has 183 pages it takes about 3 minutes to learn how to do the  basics. Truly impressive. I went on my merry way and shot a whole bunch of  pictures. Upon returning home I installed the included software and  downloaded the pictures. One gripe regarding the software package;it would  be nice to have a &quot;Lite&quot; version of the instructions for use for  us novices. I'm sure the help section has an answer to every question, but  all I want to do is the basics and this software has so many features it  gets to be a pain to find answers. I did get it working tho, and am truly  impressed with the quality of the pictures I took. I did not get the power  converter, but am planning to use rechargable batteries so the drain during  downloading is no issue. All in all I find this camera a pleasure to use  for a first time user like me, and I'm sure if you bother to find out all  the features for just about anyone. All in all a great product!",From a novice,1
959,12900,"This is my first digital camera and my very first camera forover $200. Overall, I'm happy with it - it's easy to carry andtakes great pictures.  There's not a pause between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture, which is a problem with other digital cameras.  Some things to keep in mind though:1. Downloading from the camera to your computer is EXTREMELY slow through the Serial Cable.  Buy the SMART DISK floppy. Basically, your memory card fits right into the floppy disk, and the floppy disk works just like any floppy.  The only bad thing about the floppy is it takes two lithium batteries.2. If you have a laptop, you probably want to buy the DDSMFLSAD Smart Media Adapter for PCMCIA slot. Does the same thing as the SMART DISK floppy, but obviously cheaper. Same downloading speed.3. If you don't buy 1 or 2, then buy an AC adapter (which by the way, doesn't come with the camera). Your camera must be on to transfer the pictures to your computer. Again, extremely SLOW.4. There isn't a protective covering for the LCD monitor, so buy a camera case. This case doesn't come with the camera. Costs around $20 at any store. Actually you can buy the Olympus 200-523 Accessory Kit which has the AC Adapter, 2 MB card, and camera case.5.  This camera comes with an 8 MB card which holds 36 HQ pictures or 18 SHQ pictures. I can't tell the difference between the two qualities.  8 MB is good enough. After taking about two days worth of pictures, I download them to my computer and erase the 8 MB card. I don't feel the need to have more or larger cards. But then again, if I traveled and didn't have access to my PC, then I would invest in a couple 32 MB card.6. Camera doesn't have zoom. I took some pictures of my friends running a marathon, and it would've been great to have the zoom feature. I sometimes regret not buying the Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera for $600.  If you like taking close-up pictures without being near the object, then don't buy this camera.So in summary, I actually spent an extra $200 bucks ($500 total) to make this purchase worthwhile.","good camera, but it costs more than you think...",1

961,12910,"Pick this camera up and you'll be reminded of the heft of older, metal-bodied 35mm film cameras. It seems that the SLR setup has added a significant weight burden, while supposedly lending better optics to the camera. In this price range, most digital cameras now offer potent optical zoom lenses (7-10x not uncommon), while the 620 makes do with a marginal 3:1 setup. In addition, while most offer resolutions in the 3+ megapixel range, the 620 is a 2.1 megapixel camera.

While the bottom  does get warm, placed on a magazine or tablecloth, there is no problem.  For me, this player finally puts DVD clearly above laserdisc.

Number two, the three major problems (Low battery life,  Overheating, and bad sound) are actually only one problem; Battery life is  solved by the many adapters that are now out there, and bad sound is easily  solved by a pair of headphones. Now, as to the overheating... ever walk  into an electronics store? I have. Ever see one of these things on display?  Do you think they stop it every two hours or so and let it cool down? NO! I  walked up to one as a movie was ending on the screen, and felt the bottom  and yes, it was a little warm, but this was hardly the scalding hot surface  that some people complain of. Before you buy one of these, try to see one  up close, I promise you that you'll fall in love instantly. The crystal  sharp screen, the sleak small remote, the easy to work controls. This  player is worth every cent it sells for, and its pros outweigh the cons ten  fold. DVD players on laptops are nowhere near this quality, and the other  units out there (though they have larger screens) are no way close to the  quality of this unit (the Sharp and Pioneer are even more expensive!  ACK! ) bottom line: Buy IT!  But be warned... if you expect a magical  machine with big screen TV display and Dolby surround sound (with it's 1/5  inch deep speakers) YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED, DUH!

The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.

989,13176,"This was the dvd player of its time.  To love this player means you can't compare it to anything of today's standards.  I've purchased this player when the price was over 300 and dvd was just making a hit and now, after more then 5 years (lost count) i still love it.  I must say that during those 5 years or so, it did everything that i wanted it to do.  I watch a lot of movies and have monthly membership and so my movie viewing is over 500 movies i think.  Anyway, it plays fine and the zoom feature is realy great.  It resembles the EZ view that a lot of dvd players now have.  The only thing that i remember about this player is that it didn't have a lot of formats that it can play.  For movies all you are stuck with are dvds.  NO VCD, no dvd-r nor dvd+r.  All it does is play dvds and the cd sound is moderate.  I've never used the HDcd option so i can't say for sure.This year, I'm starting to notice that it is starting to show its wear but that is ok because it has exceeded my expectations already.  I would say that it gives error messages 1 out of every 10 movies that I load up and it seems to get worst each month.  The dual tray isn't used anymore because it has too many moving parts.  Most new players gives you 1 or 5 trays but nothing in between.  Even I knew from the start that the trays were problematic since it sometimes doen'st switch to other dvds but i never knew if that was the player or the dvd itself.This year, it has been pushed back from the living room to just a sleeping room due to other players with better format and options.  Still, it's a good player but i think you will find multiple formats of dvd-r and dvd+r better in the newer players for a few more bucks.

Noone else  was apparently using FRS in the area when we were there, and it was  excellent for confirming rendezvous times and places. The range is superb.  Somewhat surprising.

I note, however, that while the speaker itself runs on 12v DC the power supply I received prominently displays an output voltage of 18v(!). If this is typical then it's little wonder so many other people report hooking up and having their speaker run for only 30 seconds before going silent. With a 50% over voltage condition nobody should be surprised at circuits burning out.Overall, my impression is that the system is built to a price point and cuts corners every way possible.

If anyone's disappointed with the quality of the video (see reviews below), they are probably being  unrealistic in their expectations. To get better video, you'd have to go up  to a 3CCD camera (at about 3times the cost!). As for those who say that the  camera is too big and heavy, I say just TRY shooting a still video without  a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book! You NEED something  larger to get a good steady picture (even with &quot;steadyshot&quot;). I  appreciate Sony's innovative digital 8 because the tapes are less  expensive, but you still have the quality of digital recording (the Pauses  are terrific!). I'm not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable  with the mini-DV format. I mean, how often would I want to trade digital  tapes with someone? I also have the option of playing back any old 8 or  hi-8 videotapes that were previously recorded, and converting them to  digital (try THAT with a mini-DV camcorder)! I like having A/V outputs AND  inputs so that I can digitally record from a source other than the camera  lens. The Sony infrared &quot;nightshot&quot; is astounding. It's like have  nightvision goggles for your camcorder! The LCD screen on the TRV310 is  WONDERFUL... 3.5 inches! The 20X optical zoom is sufficient, and going  partway into the digital zoom ain't too bad either (as long as you don't  try to actually use the full 360X!)

Now that they are made in China, there is no reliability in the products.I'd suggest \buy at your own risk\ and understand that this radio has a short shelf-life.The audio quality (while typical for a radio having a speaker this small) was GOOD. It had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area, miles away from FM transmitters. My old Sony portable radio (which I purchased and took to Russia in 1989 in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the USA) finally died after 20 years. The Grundig (when it worked) never performed as well as my Sony (made in Japan)but I wasn't too disappointed with the performance of Shortwave listening on this tiny radio. The Sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the Grundig and the Sony had vastly superior audio, despite having a speaker about the same size as the Grundig.******* UPDATE.  This Grundig radio EASILY \dies\ often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days. I thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and I was about to shoot a video to post on YouTube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it \died.\  However, I have been able to get this radio to working again (on several occasions) by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own, that there is a very VERY tiny reset button under the batteries.

And, believe me, all three of them see ample use.The price has really gone down a lot since these came out, making these a wonderful bargain.  If you are looking for something low cost that will keep on ticking movie-in, movie-out then this is the unit for you.There are many features that I like about this as well.  You get full digital sound from the player.  It has an S-Video output option as well as component outputs.  If you turn off the player than it will resume playing where you left off.  The remote control is easy to use.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this unit othe than the fact that it isn't progressive scan.Highly recommended!!!",A DVD Workhorse,1
1039,13906,"I had initially purchased Pioneer DV525 which is also a nicemodel in the sub $300 range. However I switched to A120 because Ineeded a DVD player which could switch &quot;black level&quot;. DV525 doesnt have that option. Also 525 is noisy compared to the A120. I have played over 30 Dolby Digital 5.1 DVDs (mostly rented)and did not find a single glitch either in picture or audio. There was no lip sync problem either. The picture quality is great (I have a Sony WEGA, which also makes a difference!). As far as audio is concerned, it plays regular audio CD perfectly (almost). However compared to 525, it is slightly behind in &quot;crispness&quot; of the sound. I have the player hooked to a Yamaha Dolby Digital receiver via an optical cable (Monster)and the S-Video goes straight into the WEGA. The disc loading time is also very small which is nice.You don't have to wait for ages to get the disc loaded. One aspect of A120 which I did not like is that you cannot change the audio/video settings while you are playing the disc. The Pioneer DV525 does let you change picture modes and audio settings while the disc is being played. Also, I wish the A120 had an amber display instead of white. Oveall an excellent buy for sub $200 price. I dont think any other player would come even close to this ! If you can get it for even sub $230, BUY IT.",Excellent DVD Player,1

Picked up the DVP-S7700 used in great condition here from an Amazon reseller for $40 bucks. All functions operate smoothly. Sound rivals or perhaps exceeds PS Audio and Proceed separates and other esoterica I've had in the past. For my older ears, it *seems* like about the best player I've had - wish I could A/B with those former players. SACD playback for the few I have is just a bonus and I don't mind the analog outs a bit.

Therefore, I was amazed that some people actually had a problem with this player as posted in some of the other reviews.  I, for one, found the sound quality to be excellent.  Incidentally, of all the professional reviews I read on the S7700, never once did I see a review mention that the sound quality of this unit was only fair.  Articles I have read have also compared this player to a top-of-the-line cd player.  And I agree with them.  After installing my player, I can honestly say my cds sounded better.  This has me convinced that not all cd players sound the same.  My only thought for people who are having sound problems is perhaps they should have a home theater technician look into their setup.  Maybe all that is needed is a small adjustment and then they will know what the rest of us are talking about when we marvel about how great a DVD player this is.

Both incompete as well as hard to use.  The Audio Manager software  shipped with the Rio never did work fully for me. I tried on two different  machines.  There is no way to even understand some of the Rio500 features  from the material shipped, or from their web site. Although eMail questions  are answered in about 24 hours, after a week of ongoing frustration I  discovered MusicMatch. I tried Real Jukebox, but suggest downloading the  free version of MusicMatch software from MusicMatch.com to use for  downloading files and for ripping CDs for use with the Rio500.  I found it  to work intuitively and easly almost from the beginning.  You will also  need to down load the free plug in from MusicMatch to enable downloading to  the Rio device. After installing Jukebox, then go to the Jukebox tab on the  website, then to plugins.

There were some very important functions that I  didn't even know about for about a month after I bought it, until I finally  found someone else on the net who was able to help me.  If you have a  Macintosh computer, then I would recomend this player to you over the other  players available for Mac OS because of the functions and the ease of use  after you get past the instruction problem, but I would not recomend buying  this if you don't know anybody else who owns one who can help you learn how  to use it.  Overall, I have to rate this player at 3 stars, but if it  wasn't for the instruction problem, I would probably rate the player at  about 4 1/2 stars.","Great product, but it needs better instructions",1

This is a major flaw, because I have some really nice tapes that I was unable to listen to.  There are ways to get around this  problem though. I highly reccomend that you duct tape the rio to a good old  sony walkman, and groove out that way.  This also allows you to look more  down to earth, rather than have people get MP3envy over your compact  MP3equipment.  (Don't try sticking the rio inside of your walkman and  closing the walkman's door- it will break the tape spindles of your  walkman).64 megs is better than a 60 minutes tape, but you can't flip  the chip.","Doesn't have auto reverse, or dolby noise reduction.","2,3"

That means you can get up to 4 whole books in the unit at once! Unabridged books, if they are short. If you are a &quot;books on tape&quot; person, you should look at the Rio's Audible Manager software that comes with it and you should check out Audible.com's 14,000 titles (again, a direct link from Amazon.com's talking books). When I commute, I don't have to fumble with tapes and I can listen to my books. I can also have them on airplanes and in hotel rooms.

To be brief, this has to be the best sounding, and most enjoyable system I have ever owned (PERIOD) . No B.S.!!! When we bought it, it came with a sub woofer which it really didn't need. I had to unplug it a couple times because it was too much (not complaining though). The only problem we've ever had was a common CD skipping issue that occured in 2004. But very minor. I'm still kind of upset because my father thought, just cause I went off to college that I wouldn't want it anymore. He threw it away. As soon as I find one for sell, i'm buying it especially if it's new (wishful thinking).

I could understand myself, especially if I spoke right into the microphone, but it was tedious listening. The 33 minute mode sounded just fine.I really like the voice activated recording. It turns off after 1 second of silence and reactivates instantly. It never cut off the beginning of a sentence - very nifty. This results in your 33 minutes capturing quite a bit of information since silent spots are 1 second max.Use the &quot;Hold&quot; button to avoid the problems some of the reviewers have mentioned about accidental recording. Their VCR's are probably blinking 12:00 right now. It's hard for me to understand how anyone could have that problem.Functionally it really only has 2 folders to store regular messages because the the third folder &quot;S&quot; is intended for scheduled messages. You can still use it like the other two folders, but it only holds 15 messages per day and is not quite as easy to navigate.It's a little small for my hand. A rectangular shape would  probably fit me better, but it's really not an issue.I still may take it back if I find a unit with better quality long play sound - but this unit does what it's supposed to do.It's cool looking...a real conversation starter, and small enough to tuck in any pant or shirt pocket.

I've had everything from a low-powered joystick to a scanner plugged into  it, and haven't experience many difficulties.  The only thing that threw it  for a curve was a USB ethernet adapter, which inexplicably stopped  functioning properly after a few hours of being plugged in to the hub.  I'm  not sure why, but it had to be plugged directly into the computer's USB  port to work reliably.That anomaly aside, the only thing I can think  of that it doesn't do what its packaging says it should, is add four ports  to your system.  It adds only three, because, of course, it has to be  plugged into one of your computer's existing ports.  Indeed, every time  you add one of these puppies to your system you're only adding three more  ports, because one port always has to be used simply as a connector.Other reviewers have pointed out that it doesn't work well on Macs or  under Windows 95.  I unfortunately haven't been able to verify either of  those statements, so I'll leave my review qualified to this extent:  by and  large, it works very well under Windows 98.

But, as a radio, it's just plain junk.Range as a handheld with the provided antenna is only around 100ft or so between two identical units, and that's with the squelch control turned off. So an external antenna is mandatory for pretty much any use.  Even when you get good reception, the audio quality from the built in speaker is flat and hard to hear.Using it while driving is the worst situation at all, since the radio is severely impacted by ignition noise from your car. Yes, this is something that you have to deal with when using just about any two-way radio, so it's not like a different brand would eliminate the problem, but this unit does not appear to have any built-in filtering to help with the issue.","Great idea, poor execution.","2,3"

1145,15272,"I bought my Midland 75-822 for its 40 channels at AM but hoped that it culd be mod to FM and 120 channels as said in some reviwes. Actually, I would prefer AM/FM CB walkie with 40 legal channels but they are second to non-exiting. (Why ?) BEWARE as of rouhgly New Year 2011 MOD to this gadget is not known anymore. Midland has CHANGED the PCB without changing the model number, so you will not be able to MOD it anymore according to recipees on the net, and it is not clear that it will be ever possible - perhaps they have somply removed the extra functionality from the chip and/or closed all loopholes permitting inadverted MODs.As for the gadget itself, it is not extremly well done - I'd say even sloppy and the manual brashly not giving enough info to the user. For example, draw of current from batteries at CB reception is incredibly high: 63mA and at wether channel even more (with volume set to minimum). Given the current state of the art of chips I would say it is virtualy imposible to arrive to such a high power consumption. The sound quality could be better especially at low signal intensities where a kind of auto-squelch cut of the RF signal producing audible distortions in the demodulated audio. The adio amplifier is irritatingly noisy even at lowest level setting and under squelch. Also annoying is the fact that if you plug normal stereo headphones you will hear tone only in left earphone whereas the right is muted. The audiuo output to the earphone is the same as of the loudspeaker meaning too noisy at normal listening level and too loud (you must keep the volume knob at very low setting if you do not want your eardrum as well as the earphone membrane blown away). The external microphone jack is unexplained in the manual: it serves at the same time as input and Push-To-Talk control (PT) - once you plug in the micophone jack your PT button is dead. Manual is mute on whether 75-822 supports condenser mic whichy requires power supply or dynamic mic or both (or none ? - I did not try any).All in all, good value for the price, standard quality but not CB-philic one.

Also make sure the antenna pivot screw is very tight else the whip has a tendency to pivot and fall while driving.

It is evolving into an \all hazards\ radio service.Radios like the Midland 74200 silently monitor the broadcasts 24/7.  When an alert is broadcast, the radio will activate, either turning on automatically, or activating an alarm that tells you a warning is being broadcast.  You can also just listen to the broadcasts.  You'll get better weather information than you will on the TV News' Doppler StormTracker Accu-Severe Weather SWAT Command Team.Every home needs one of these radios. Think of it as a smoke alarm for the outdoors.The Midland 74200 is one of the best units available.  It has a feature called Specific Area Messaging Encoding (SAME) which allows you to program it to only receive alerts for the counties you are interested in.  This is a necessary feature - with it you won't be awakened at 2 AM for a flood alert three counties away.It's a bit of a chore to program, but the manual is very helpful.  Once it is set up, it works beautifully.  Good reception of all 7 weather radio channels. Is small and unbstrusive, and can function as an alarm clock.  The battery backup will ensure that you will be alerted if the AC power goes out.If you live where there is weather, you need one of these radios.  The 74200 will fit the bill perfectly, and is priced reasonably for a full-featured weather radio.",One Of The Best Weather Alert Radios,1

1163,15511,"These little things are great! I took them with me on vacation, and used them in the hotel. They worked between 4 floors with no interfernece! And while scanning channels we found other people with the same radios! We  never had any problems with them and they worked just as advertised!",These Little Things Are Great!,1
1164,15514,I was looking around for the best pair of radios for the best price and here they are! What a great price! I'd recommend them for anyone who wants a great deal. They work about 1.5 miles when I used them in the city and I  was satisfied with that!,Great Price!,1
1165,15515,We already own a pair of Motorola 280SLK's.  We bought this one for our son.  It's easier to to deal with a $29 radio being lost compared to one  that cost $129.It works well when we communicate with our Motorola  radios.  The buttons are easy for a child to use.  Battery life is very  good.  We bought some AA NiCd recharable batteries.  I'm glad we bought it  and our son has fun using it.,Good deal for the money.  It makes a great spare FRS radio.,1
1166,15538,"As a volunteer fireman, emergency medical responder and a member of a K-9 search team I have radio equipment that is on the public service frequencies.  That stuff is expensive.  This Midland is a surprising value  for the price.  Good basic communication, clarity and straightforward  operation are pluses.  Spouse says it is big on Cute and that counts to  her.  Mostly, I am surprised by the quality rec'd for the money paid. Very  enthusiastic about use fishing on river, working on property or apart when  4 wheeling.",Great Value!,1
1167,15539,"Class D citizen band provides an excelent very short distance communication.  With the FCC only legally allowing 4 watts on 11 meters your range is very limited; all CB's can potentially be modified however for a illegal higher output.  Unless your running a half wave base antenna, a nice beam, or a extremely long hi-gain mobile antenna dont expect much from this rig, or any other CB rig.  With the new FRS fad they are pounding in the 2 mile range... however this is not true because one they run in (FM)frequency modulation mode which has excelent sound but its mainly line of sight communication only, two they have extreme power restrictions and no external antennas; those 350 miliwatts of power will barely get you a mile unless your in an excelent terrain.  I highly recomend AM mode for distance, however if your going to buy a CB get one with (SSB) single side band which will allow you to use a portion of an AM wave the upper or lower part.  In side band mode your 4 watt radio will produce 12 watts of legal power because you are only using the top, or bottom part of a wave without a carrier, this tends to be garbled so constant adjustment with the clarifier nobb may be neaded. As well on CB..11 meters if your lucky in the heat of the summer days the band accasionaly will open up and allow your radio wave to skip clear across the world; this is rare though running such low power but it is possible and ive seen it happen.  But for those who seek the distance of radio Amateur (HAM) radio is what its all about.  The FCC has made it possible to become a liscensed ham operator without knowing morse code anymore and a 35 question test which you can pass with a 70%.  As a ham operator i can tell you its very rewarding, repeaters are free to use and usually have about a 25-40 mile range which you can hit with just miliwatts of power, or for those who seek long communications it is legal to run up to 1.5 kilowatts (1500 watts) of brute power.  Although this is not neaded you can easily work the world with low power on certain bands.  And with repeater ive hit some of them next to 100 miles away running only 5 watts on 2 meter fm.  but thats all i have to say73'skcmvl",the dissapearing citizen band,"2,3"
1168,15558,"These days 10 preset stations for a radio is not much, and it also is a little oversized. What I like about it is the clock and -especially- the timer that lets you listen for a certain number of minutes (between 1 and 120) before it stops the radio and starts beeping. Of course, if you turn it off/on before the set time, the radio will not stop, and the beep will not sound. Tuning is very good but sound is not the best (a personal opinion, certainly).",Good product,1

1174,15665,"The Allsop DVD/VHS Slotless MovieStore Organization System is exactly what  I was looking for to shelve my growing DVD library.  I wanted something I  could add on to inexpensively, but which would also make transporting easy  if I needed to move the DVDs or tapes stored.  I also wanted an  interlocking system, so that individual components could be added to  vertically or horizontally.  Many tapes and DVDs come in two, three, four  or more item sets; so a slotless system was required.  Allsop's system  met all of my requirements.  I can add to the system as I add to my  collection.  When I need more components to house new additions to the  collection, I can acquire them individually as required.  If I want to take  some DVDs to a friend's, I simply take one component from the shelf, slip  in the titles I want, and they are held securely for transport.  I  would like to see a floor base for the design.  This would make  floor-to-ceiling shelving possible without resting the bottom row of a  collection directly on the floor, but I've found resting the bottom row on  the flat side of a rough-cut 2 by 4 trimmed to the width of the shelf row I  want works adequately to place a 2&quot; space between the floor and the  bottom of the component shelving.",Ideal DVD/VHS System,1

And with my banged up knees I sure can't catch them!  So after looking at reviews I purchased the Kensington Microsaver Notebook Lock and Security Cable.  Now, whenever I use my laptop in public, I routinely cable lock it to a chair, table or whatever else is handy.  I usually run the cable through the handles of my laptop bag as well for bag security.  You do need to be realistic about the lock and cable.  It does give you peace of mind, but use common sense about where you leave your laptop and for how long.",Peace of mind with Kensington notebook lock and security cable,1
1181,15750,"Just received this lock. First impressions are good, the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product. The key is big and easy to locate. The ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched (not really a concern on *this* laptop).I can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device. There is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off. Things that I am thinking of now are specific to my laptop. The Kensington slot is right by my system fan, which I have a laptop that blows out 1000 degree air. The metal lock gets very hot. Perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves.It's no secret that cable can be cut, the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it.",Pleased today,1
1182,15754,"Maybe it's just me, or where the locking slot is my docking station, but it's awfully hard to get the darned key to turn. You have to push in and compress the rubber ring to get the key to turn. Difficult in an awkward space. And the keys are biggish for use on a key chain. Ended up not using it for docking station use - will use it only when traveling, which means it'll rarely get used.","Hard to use, keys kinda big",2

Just make sure the black rubber part of the lock is touching the computer, thats when you know its fully in then you can lock it in place.  The bad part is that my MacBook Pro put the lock insert hole on the right side of the computer.  So it bothers me when I am using my mouse.  But besides that it does its job.",Does its job,1

Have read complaints that trackballs hurt your wrists and this is probably true if you don't rest your forearm on the copious extra desk space you'll have because you don't have to move it around. Wish it had a scroll ring (innovation to substitute for scroll wheel) but it's an older model. Kensington makes the best trackballs and the newer versions have scroll rings and optical tracking. The little glass beads inside collect dust, but the ball pops out for easy cleaning. The rubber rollers on this one will decompose over time from age and skin oils so it's more of a collector's item- my newer Kensington optical does the grunt work. Cordless is a more expensive option- maybe someday.Thx...",Good trackball for a reasonable price,1
