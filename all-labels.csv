1,10,"I have owned two Rand McNally GPS devices over the last two years. Buyer beware! They are pieces of junk. The software is great, but the hardware does not last. The first GPS lasted a year. I spent another $400, that one lasted about 14 months. If you don't mind spending $400 a year for a GPS buy one. Otherwise do not buy it it is the worst and most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought. I still use my original GARMIN I purchased in 2006.",Piece of Junk,2
2254,14,"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",1st impression,"2,3"
2255,17,"I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7\ GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7\.  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\ and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\ bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\ color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \Construction Ahead\ and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy.",Excellent buy,"1,3,4"
2256,19,I was real psyched when i got it and all the features are what i was looking for in a truck gps. Well that all went away real quick.1.The log feature and milage is inaccurate.2.The speed limits are way off all throughout the country.3.The screen is hard to read on sunny days.4 The  suction cup mount is clunky and comes loose constantly.5.It sent me over ebbers pass while trucking to Lake Tahoe last week.  (14% grade for 15 miles) I won't do that again.6. The power switch has recessed into the unit and will not turn back on.7.Called tech support about returning the unit and the guy barely spoke english.8.I expected better from rand mc'nally.,Don't buy the hype on this one.,"2,3"
2257,20,"Thought the unit was going to be a good unit, but was I wrong very wrong. The unit has a bad probleum with the 12 volty pulg in. They replaced the unit once in 6 months and the second unit last about 8 months before it started giving me trouble, but would they stand behind it NO NO NO. They said it had been over a year since I had bought the first unit so it was not covered.  The person I talked with at the Tec centered knew very well what I was talking about. If I made something that cost as much and made claims of how great a unit it was I would stand behind it and if I knew of probleums with the 12 plug in I would come up with a fix.  So take your chances if you buy one from Rand McNally hope it last for you but I have my doughts.

2,25,"I've had this for about 6 months now. This is the worst GPS I've owned out of 4. It very seldom picks the best, or shortest route. It will let you put in multiple stops, but you only get info to the NEXT one. If you don't like a route and put in a VIA, guess what you only get info to the new VIA, how am I supposed to know if the new route is better? Routing is unbelievably slow, I've had it take up to 30 minutes, then get it wrong. Adding things to the notes just puts it into one long line. How about putting a return so I can at least organize a little bit. Very cumbersome to use, it's of little or no use for long range trip planning.

7,76,This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom.

Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software.

My only complaint, why I rate this as 4 stars, is that I have to clean the screen even with the cover fairly frequently because its beyond easy to leave finger smudges all over it even with clean hands. I dont mind though. If im too lazy to clean the screen I just place my hand flat on it & run my hand across evenly so that everything turns into one big smudge that I can see fine through :P.

Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.

Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it.

Hex head lag screws that are included which are a breeze to drive into the stud.  I purchased a mount previously that had a phillips head on the lag screws and that really made them a job to drive into the stud.  Since the TV was rather large (400x400 vesa mounting pattern) I had to use the extension arms off of the main plate as shown in the picture.  They were surprisingly very easy to attach.  A nice plastic cover is included which slides back over the wall mounting plate to conceal the mounting screws - I thought that was a nice touch.Overall an excellent product and I would easily purchase another if I had another TV to wall mount.,Excellent for large LCD screens,1

Only reason for docking one star is the difficulty in adjusting the unit in the beginning. You really need (on my unit at least) to work it for a while before installing so you don't have to put so much stress on the mounts once installed. It was VERY stiff and took quite a bit of muscle to loosen it up enough to adjust...even with the adjusters loosened for this purpose...suppose it's better to have it too tight than loose and have the tv \drift\ around.For $25.00 that I paid for a decent mount that has the range of angles...great find.,Great value,"1,4"

2290,539,"This is a heavy duty bracket and I successfully mounted a 32 inch Sansui LCD TV in about 2 hours, taking my time. There are two \tools\ provided. One is a hex key and it works. The other in a small box wrench. Throw the box wrench away as it is at least 1mm larger than the lags bolts provided and thus slips when used, could cause minor injury, and is totally useless. BTW, the pre- mounted bolts, as shipped, are torqued on tightly, watch the fingers and hands so as not to mash them once the torque pressure is released as you untighten them.  I strongly suggest using your own tools. Either a racket wrench or correct size box wrench. The lag bolts provided for mounting are large and should be mounted in a wall stud 2x4. To prevent splitting the stud, drill progressively larger pilot holes until you acheive the size correct for the mounting the lag bolts. The instructions are minimal and vague. For instance, there is a small component provided which looks like a screw cap with a small barbell thru the top.  Interesting, but here is no explanation what it is for. Also the mounting lag bolts should be six in number; only five were included in my shipment, so I winged it with a lag bolt of my own.  Mounting the TV to the TV plate has to be somewhat intuitive; screws are provided for most configurations. In summary, I liked this product but it has the snags, the bewilderments, and the amusements and the WTFs that plague most manufactured products made in China. For the price, we don't get German engineered quality or Swiss logic.  Bottom line is that it works.","Good bracket, couple snags.","1,3"

47,699,"Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

1249,706,"Having purchased this mount for an application it wasn't really intended for, it's doing just what I needed.I was looking for a way to wall mount a fairly hefty Polk Audio Monitor 40 to use as a center channel speaker for my HT sound system. Polk recommends these speakers be mounted at least 2' off the wall to keep from muffling the rear facing bass port and this mount fits the bill to a T for a heck of a lot less expense than the typical center channel speaker stands sell for ... Bonus!BTW, these Polk Monitor 40s are essentially the same speaker as their purpose built center channel speakers for 1/2 the price as I got a pair of 'em for what Polk sells single center channel speakers, and .... got a 2nd one to use for the center channel for my BR system in the process. So long as you don't mind either standing them up as intended or that the Polk emblem ends up sideways when you lay 'em on their sides like I did, they make a great center channel speaker for a bargain price.This did require some inventive modifying with my die grinder and a cut off wheel to cut away most of the mounting pad intended for attaching to various monitors/Tvs, then a lil touch up painting after the cutting but what I ended up with was just what I needed. The cable management already in place works just as well for speaker wire as it would have for an HDMI or similar video cable too.Yeah, these are of Chinese manufacture, but I was unable to find a similar American made product, and let me assure you, I did try.

2307,804,"Very sturdy and easy to install no sagging at all with the weight of TV.  The only place for a TV in my living room is in a corner so this mount did the trick and was fairly easy to adjust. Just follow the directions. Figure out how high you want want it, locate the center of the stud, pre-drill the hole and use a ratchet to screw in the bolts. The bottom screw hole gives a bit of wiggle room to get it perfectly level. The plate for the TV side is a quick release so it's easy to get the TV on arm after it's been mounted. Everything adjusts with ease if it moves or tilts too easy or too stiff , then tighten up or loosen a bolt or two. My TV uses the VESA 400x400 screw pattern and it lined up fine.",It was perfect for my 46\ 38lb LED TV,1
2308,808,"Now that it is installed it is fine.  But installation was a pain.  Unlike other similar low priced mounts, this does not have a separate plate that you mount to the TV then mount to the bracket.  You have to hold the TV up in position, align with bracket holes and start screws.  Try that on ladders 6 feet in the air,  with a 40 or 50 pound TV.  I bought some screws of proper size, cut off the head and used 2 as locating guides to get screw holes aligned.  Started 2 screws then replace my starter studs with screws. Made it easier but NOT easy.  Also adjustment is very difficult with TV installed.  Weight of TV binds the adjusting bracket when you loosen set screw.  I would NOT recommend this mount there are better choices.  I got an OMNIBasics OBFM60 mount for a similar price ( on clearance) and it was 5 STARS compared to this.",HARD TO MOUNT,"2,3"

I have ordered another VideoSecu articulating wall mount like this one for a similiar installation of a 32inch Vizio.I suggest one person hold the mounted TV where you would like it to swing out to, and have another person hold the wall attachment and mark the holes.

1257,836,"Purchased this as an Xmas gift in order to mount a 32\ Dynex TV, which was also a gift. If you've done any research whatsoever, you'll first note that mounts such as these are at least $100+ in stores like Best Buy, PC Richards and more. So, with that said even though I was looking for a better deal, I must admit I was a little nervous about this purchase. WELL, nerves were immediately settled when I finally got the item. Everything was shipped very well and upon opening the box for the actual mount (it was even double boxed for shipping!), I found all items to be in tact. The product was brand new with no signs of rust or chipping, as some have experienced with other mounts. I found the hardware for the lightweight Dynex 32\ TV to be more than adequate for mounting and the process OF mounting took all of about 15-20 minutes. Included in the package was a small level and also an HDMI cable which has been working just fine for our son who has used it to hook up his Playstation 3.

58,854,This was installed by two handy men - the first they had every done.  Went very well.  This mount was chosen because of the 20  inch extension.  The wall is recessed so the TV needs to come out of that hole.  The mounting plate sets above the 23\ LED TV an inch but the length of the extension makes that O.K.  I would have done this myself (68 yo female) except the handy stud finder declared the whole 3' wall was a stud!!  With much chatting the handy men were finished in 45 minutes.,Flat screen TV mount 20\ extention,5
1259,863,"This is a very sturdy and high quality wall mount. The metal is indicative of much higher-priced models than the low price of this item. Once you have it mounted, it works great with a full range of motion and the tv feels very secure.The only problem I have is the installation process itself. You have to loosen all the nuts required for getting the range of motion, and it seems that the nuts were all tightened at the strongest-man-in-the-world competition. It was VERY difficult to get them to loosen initially.The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness, but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems, I had to come up with a jury-rig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV (Sony Bravia). It's not a bad solution - putting the screw through one of the slats rather than an actual screw hole along with adding a couple washers to create tension with the too-long screws - but I'd rather it be truly universal as the description claims.But even with the installation difficulties, I'd still buy the product again because it's great quality for a low price.",Works great...once you go through the pain of getting it installed,"1,4"

1261,874,"This bracket was easy for my husband to mount.  I have to admit, I was extremely nervous hanging our 46 inch TV, as the bracket really didn't look all that strong.  But that was deceiving, and after a few days of nervousness, we are noow perfectly comfortable with the way the bracket mounts our TV diagonally in the corner of the room.",Great TV bracket,2
2313,885,"I bought this mount to hang a 32\ Sony in my bedroom. Like others I was very skeptical because of the price. I read through the instructions and determined what parts I would need and in less than 20 minutes I had it on the wall and done. The only thing I would suggest is for those who plan to mount this into a concrete or brick wall, don't use the masonry anchors. The one's they provide are pretty cheap. Overall I am really happy with the mount, it swivels just like it should and is definitely robust enough for a larger TV.",Easy to use and great value,"1,3"

2315,892,"I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.",It Works But Could Be Better,"1,4"

It is well built. The next step down is just shoddy construction.",VideoSecure 22\ to 37\ TV Wall Mount,"1,4"

1262,903,I had low expectations from a TV mount priced this low. This is a well built mount and well worth the price. I was surprised at the quality and construction of it. I was able to install the mount and install the 24\ TV in less than 1/2 hour. I would have given it 5 stars if the instructions gave drill bit sizes instead of just 'drill holes'.,Very nice mount,1
2318,904,This is the second time I purchased one of these brackets.  It's solid and easy to install.  The included hardware allows for many TV mounting options.,Reliable,1
1263,909,"Compared to many of the other mounts, this one was a great value! Comes with a bunch of different parts to fit different sized tvs. Range of motion is exactly what I was looking for and I have no qualms about fully extending the arm forward with full weight of the tv. A bit difficult to install by yourself if you have a larger tv and if you have to keep in mind how much area you need if you were to fully extend it left and right (arm length plus tv width).",Great Value,1
1264,911,"I originally bought this for a Sony 40&#34; TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42&#34; instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.",Well worth the money,"1,4"

2325,962,"TV has been mounted about two weeks and still holding up.  Pretty easy to adjust the TV to different angles.  Overall installing the TV mount wasn't hard.  The only thing that gave us a little trouble was the TV had a little raised curve on the back.  Therefore when we tried to attach the bar that connects to the TV, the bars did not sit flush.  We had to cut those bars down to get a flush mount.  Not sure if that is a fault of the TV mount or the TV itself.  Note: I don't know how the mounting sizes are created, i.e. 300x300, but the mount did say it would fit my TV and we still had to cut those bars.  Not a big deal to me and the mount still works well but this is something you may want to factor into your buying decision.

I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.The quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.As others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read. Sure I'd like higher quality scans, but I own both the Rolling Stone and National Geographic box sets and poor quality scans are an issue for all digitized magazines.

There have to be almost pristine copies of every issue out there so I can't see that there is much excuse for having missing pages and coffee stains etc. There is even one missing centerfold picture with a post-it note scanned with one of the 3 pages. My biggest disappointment though is that the scans of the centerfolds from the late 1980s on are so bad. They are high resolution but the colors, contrast and saturation and every other setting is so far off they practically don't look like the published photos at all.

This was a question we even asked at the store and the guy said all the book prices are set and the same everywhere. This is completely untrue. I tried to check out ebooks from the local library and was unable to do that either. There was this whole big process with downloading some adobe and having to put the book on a computer and then on the nook. I gave up after about 20 min of trying. Wish I would've bought the kindle fire or an ipad and simplified my life. And what happens if B&N goes out of business like Borders? Then the device is useless since it's only meant for B&N products.

2336,1080,"Hi folks,I have just purchased a brand new Barnes & Noble 16 GB Nook Tablet. I've been wanting an eBook reader for quite awhile, so I was really excited when it arrived by FedEx this morning.I'm a disabled American Veteran, and on a very limited income, so I receive a small allowance each month for my personal items. I had to save for several months in order to purchase an e-book reader. I did a lot of Internet searches, reading, and comparing features before choosing the \Nook\. I also based my choice on past experiences with Barnes & Noble (book stores). I never expected them to \ROB\ me as they did.I bought the Nook with my own money, and it is mine. Shame on you B&N; for stealing from a loyal (ex) customer. I trusted you and you stole from me.If any of you are thinking about a Nook, \Be YE Forewarned\ B&N; has a nasty little bit of firmware just waiting for you, on the Internet. This little thief will lock up your Nook so you will only be able to download books and apps from Barnes & Noble.You will buy only the things they sell and you will pay their prices. There are so many free apps and ebooks available, but you will not be allowed to have them, if you purchase a Nook. If I had it in my power, I would have everyone to buy some other brand and teach the \Big Guys\ a lesson on how to treat people. Had I known about this \Hi Jacking\ of my property, I would not have purchased it. I hate to sound like I'm pissed off, but I am pissed off.With all the nice features, the Nook would be a great piece of technology, were it not for the stinking little virus waiting for you out there in Cyber land.Tom MullisPS: For those of you who know how, you can do this thing called, \rooting\ but there are many of us who are not able to do this procedure. And I'm pretty sure Barnes & Noble will soon write a piece of software that will take the Nook back, and prevent you from doing it again. The folks at B&N; are not dumb, they will figure it out. They are not dumb, but they are crooks, willing to cheat and steal for that, \almighty doller\. So beware.By the way, are there any lawyers out there willing to take on a \class action\ suit? I do hope so. Tom","I paid good money for my Nook, It's mine. Shame on you B&N",2
1277,1082,"Word of warning...you only get 1 GB of free space for non B&N purchases. If you have a large collection of eBooks, songs or movies, you simply can't get them on.",Only 1 GB for non B&N material,2

I've order a new bigger battery we'll see if I can actual get the new battery in without breaking the reader (you have to take the reader a part to change the battery, see YouTube).

1278,1093,"My wife got me a Nook Tablet 16 GB for Christmas and I'm stilled thrilled to have a nice sized device for web browsing, watching Netflix, and Flash videos on the web.  I was really interested in an iPad, but always balked at the price and not a fan of iTunes syncing or using iTunes on my PC at all.  I have an iPhone 4 for my job and I was no longer all that excited about Apple's app store and all the dedicated apps that seem to offer stripped down versions of the web sites, games, or programs that I really want to use on a larger screen.  The Nook Tablet is a great little device, sized just fine for what I use it for and the price is better compared to the iPad.  I really don't read a lot of e-books or e-magazines, but when I do read them on the Nook Tablet, it's a nice experience, but I still prefer physical books and magazines.  It plays MP3s and up to 1080p videos just fine, but like I mentioned, I'm not a fan of having to plug the device into my PC to sideload content or load media onto a memory card (though it's really nice that the Nook has a micro SD slot).  If you're looking for a device for web-browsing, Netflix-watching, and Scrabble (pretty much the only game that I want play on it), then this is a great device.  B&N is still at a disadvantage with a pretty limited app selection compared to Google Play and Amazon's app store and of course Apple's App Store, but after being enamored with my work phone (iPhone 4) for about six months, I'm over the apps and much happier with the Nook Tablet's larger screen, with the 1 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM, there's plenty of power for my casual web browsing and video watching at home.","Great device for web browsing, Netflix, and Flash video.  Magazines, Books, and Apps are all right..","1,4"
1279,1104,"Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \My Stuff\ so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \locations\ like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.",Outstanding 7\ Tablet,"1,4"
2338,1109,"...for heavens sake. First thing first, to those reading this, contemplating if you should make a comparison between iPad or Nook Tablet, don't even bother. Hands down we ALL know that the iPad will win the case. If your main purpose is to get an ebook and browse the internet, then you can read on.I was at a store and bought it after I touched, felt and browsed on the web with this. The main purpose of of me even looking at this tablet AND Kindle Fire was to find a device that I can read and surf the net. I have an iPhone and do not need an expensive device of the iPad to do the same function as my phone.I decided to get the Nook Tablet as the internet browses a little faster than the Kindle Fire. Maybe it was love at first sight, who knows.Since I am not an IT person and did not buy this device to download apps and games, I like the Nook Tablet. It serves the purpose of me being able to read magazines in color (just like the real magazine), buy books online and read childrens books to my baby. Youtube and Netflix work fine without a hitch...so no complains.I did not mind paying $60 more than the Kindle Fire and have not regret my decision in getting the Nook Tablet.",Its a Nook...,1

1281,1133,"I love having an electronic book reader, but the Nook Color is a big disappointment.  It has so many really irritating quirks and problems.  I've never used any other brand, so I can't compare, but I definitely don't recommend getting a Nook Color.The biggest problem is that the battery life is abysmal.  After just a couple months use, I now only get about 2 hours of use on a full charge, even with the screen dimmed quite a bit.  Since I want to use this when I'm traveling and don't usually have access to an outlet, this is a HUGE problem and extremely limits its usefulness.Besides that:* It has a tendency to turn itself on.  This happens whenever I put in or remove the power plug and sometimes just when it gets jostled.  Sometimes I don't notice because the cover is closed. Turning itself on after I remove the power plug definitely doesn't help with the already abysmal battery power.* When I'm using it while it is plugged in and charging, which is most of the time because of the poor battery, it repeatedly displays the battery charging message, ever 10-20 seconds for a second or so.  This is VERY disruptive when trying to read, forcing me to pause and wait until it disappears.*  While reading, the menu at the bottom pops up A LOT too, for no apparent reason, covering the lower text.* Sometimes books get stuck on one page and won't advance or will skip pages.  It takes quite a bit of finagling to get it to show the missing pages.* There are a few spots on the screen that don't respond to touch, especially near the upper and right edges, which is where webpages usually have critical navigation buttons.* The zoom feature is very hard to use, and the zoom level doesn't stay the same  when moving from page to page, especially on websites. I try to zoom the webpages so I can access buttons under the dead touchscreen spots, but the page won't stay zoomed in when trying to move the page to get to the desired spot.* The touchscreen doesn't work well on webpages, often selecting a different item than the one touched.  This often sends me zinging off to undesired links.* The on-screen keypad doesn't always pop up when trying to type something on a webpage, and there's no way to manually make it show.* The Nook's book filing system is rudimentary and hard to sort.  I would especially like to be able to sort by rating, but it doesn't allow that.  I'd also like to be able to tag books, but can't do that either.* The B&N; online store search is terrible.  You can't do a dual search to narrow down long lists, and it will only list the books alphabetically by title.  On the tiny Nook screen, it takes forever to scroll through long results.  You can't exclude tags.  When I search for mysteries, there's all this paranormal stuff mixed in that I'd like to exclude but can't.* I can't look through my own reviews on the Barnes and Noble website using the Nook Color.  It doesn't support that feature.  I can only access them on my regular laptop.  Dunh.  I read a lot of books and can't keep track of all of them.  It would be handy when I'm thinking about buying a book by an author I've read before to be able to see what I thought of the author's other book.* Some Google apps and Flash Player apps don't work on the Nook.  I subscribe to NFL Game Rewind, something I enjoy when I'm on the road, but I can't watch it on my Nook Color.One thing I do like is that there are a lot of really good, free books for the Nook Color available through the B&N; online store.And I like that I can watch Netflix.","abysmal battery life, plus lots of really irritating little problems","2,3"

Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen, making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.2. Great storage. The Nook Tablet has 16 GB built in, and the memory is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD[HC] Card. Content stored on card runs pretty fast for a Tablet.3. Best-ever e-book reader. Its nothing that can be fought againsed: Nooks are the best e-readers of all time. You can change the size of the text, background page color and picture settings easy. Has a built-in dictionary that can be used to look up words that you don't understand in that new Hunger games best-seller, or just to look up any random word when reading Pilgrim's Progress. Overall, a great E-Reader.4. Large selection of apps. The Nook store always will have the newest Fruit Ninja app, the new temple Run and much more. ranging from gaming apps to apps that will help your business thrive, the Nook store has it all.Con's1. The processor. Sometimes the Nook will run into reboots that can take up to a minute, though they never actually seem to help the Nook itself. It can't handle that many downloads at once, which can make your downloading of the Angry Birds series.2. Hard to unlock. Unlike allot of other tablets, Barnes & Noble really have this one guarded. It is very hard to hack it (Legally)to get all of the Google Play apps. There's a card that can do that, but it costs $50. So, not the best for the techy-app types.3. Poor speaker. The Nook's speaker isn't the best. Even at full volume it isn't that loud. The only way to really hear anything good is with headphones.So, it seems like there's some for getting it and some for not getting it. But it sure works for me. At least it has a better e-reader than the Kindle Fire.",A pretty good Tablet.,1

At night when I can't sleep I watch movies on Netflix and play games on it. I am sure I will have to buy my daughter one sooner or later, and my oldest grandson Loves it, he plays games and gets to read childrens books on it.

2346,1209,"First learn about modifying the nook tablet.  You can buy or create yourself a sd card with a custom ROM on it. Doing this lets you bypass the BN OS because the nook looks at the sd card first when booting up, it also keeps the nook OS stock and BN can do all the firmware updates they want to do without affecting the SD Card ROM.  With a custom ROM you can install apps or read ebooks not offered by BN i. e. kindle books. I love my NT and learned to make it do more than be an ereader, yet still have a stock ereader by swapping to a blank sd card. Let your Nook Tablet be an Android Tablet without the restrictions of BN's poor customer service.

2347,1213,"For the price this is a great tablet. It lacks a camera, GPS, and bluetooth, but that still leaves a lot, between web browsing and running lots of Android apps. Barnes and Noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but I did get around that by rooting mine.That said, I was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by Amazon today. The newer version is faster, has a higher resolution screen, is lighter despite same screen size, and has bluetooth. (Still no camera or GPS). B&N; also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I don't know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card). The HD works well off a rooted Jelly Bean card.","Great, But New Version Is Even Better","1,3,4"

The fact that it's easy to use right out of the box, that it has good connection speed, doesn't require a 3g plan, and what I've tried to do has worked pretty well.  However, there is a lot left to be desired especially in the way of apps.  Admittedly, I have been spoiled by Apple's wide app variety on my ipod touch, but I have noticed a scarcity of apps for very common and popular programs that irritates me.  For example, youtube: one can get on youtube from the web browser, but it lacks the usability of an app on a tablet device.  Skype is another.  I contacted support and was told that the tablet did not support skype because \it doesn't have a built in camera.\I understand that this is a new product and much is still being developed, but the Nook has a long way to go before it has the range and depth to fully satisfy.  These are only two examples of several programs I've found lacking with this tablet.

2355,1306,"This \tablet\ is terrible, extremely frustrating and is definitely not user-friendly. It is NOT a tablet, it's a reader. If you want a true tablet, just spend the extra $100 and get the iPad Mini.We got this around Christmas time, thinking it would be a great tablet for the whole family to use. We were so wrong.While the display is crisp, everything else sucks and it is not user friendly at all. I can't understand why some people gave this thing high ratings - the only explanation would be that they have never held an Apple product in their hands...For start, the browser is the most frustrating browser out there - terrible. Even those we installed were terrible. It keeps freezing all the time and everything takes forever.Then the sensitivity of the touch screen is awful which will make you want to pull your hair out while using the browser, not even comparable to the browser sensitivity and intelligence on iPhones and iPads, not even close!The profiles don't work - we set 3 profiles - one for me, one for my husband and one for our son who is 2.5. One would think that in my profile I will see my stuff. Wrong! Once I go to my profile after my husband had been using the tablet, open the browser - I don't see my tabs, I see all of my husband's tabs he was just viewing like NFL stuff and all my tabs from when I used it are gone. My twitter account is gone - I see my husband's twitter so I manually have to sign him out and then sign myself in... What's the point of the profiles when they simply do not work!?!?And the apps, of course, cannot be compared to those available at the Apple Store. It's a joke! Tiny selection of kids movies and kids apps and the kids apps are so poorly made and so terrible, my son was not interested at all. I had to show him so many times how to use them yet he still struggled and was not interested. He'd rather play with the apps on my iPhone and I didn't even show him how to use them. Apple is just so intuitive and so easy to use.There's no Facebook app (maybe they added it by now - I hope!), no Pinterest app, no Etsy app, no eBay app, no PayPal app... I can go on and on and on...And then of course, this thing doesn't have a camera. It kills me when I see commercials for Kindles and Nooks and they have their tablet next to the iPad Mini and say that everything on these tablets is the same, except for the price. Yes, the iPad Mini costs an extra $100, but it has a camera so you can make pictures and videos and skype on it. It also has a lot more apps and a bigger screen! (almost 8\). So there you go, spend that extra $100 and get the iPad Mini, you get what you pay for. Unless, of course, you want to use your Nook HD just for reading books and watching movies because that's exactly what Nook HD is - a reader & a movie viewer.One more thing - B&N; customer service sucks!

I've always loved my Nook color but without Google Play Store it was only good for reading and movies...the apps were too limited and there weren't too many free ones. I really thought I was ok with that and just used it for Reading.Then I saw the Nook HD 7\. $129 for 8gb and $149 for the 16gb...got the 16gb...At first I thought I had made a mistake...No Google Play Store...but once it updated and I got all the Apps I wanted....Wow.

94,1393,"Overall, I think the Nook tablet is a pretty good tablet.  It has a great price, the screen is good and the colors look great on it, but there are two major issues that I have with this tablet that keep it from being truly great.My first issue that I have with it is that the OS/Nook Software that it comes with is extremely limited.  I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and I was sorely disappointed to see that a lot of the apps/games that she wanted either were not available at all or had a price attached to them through the B&N; store.  These are the same games you can get for free through the Google Play store.  I was pretty mystified to say the least.My next issue, and perhaps the biggest issue I have, is their charger.  It's a proprietary charger (not your standard USB universal charger) and it SUCKS.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It's cheap/flimsy and I've had to replace it numerous times because the prong is extremely weak/fragile.  There's not even a good after-market charger that you can buy to rectify the situation.  All of the chargers that I've seen (whether it be through B&N; or after-market) are crap and it's only a matter of time before you'll have to replace them.  At $10 a pop (through B&N;), this can add up.I was able to solve the first problem by rooting the tablet to run Android and get the Google Play store, but sadly there's no fix to the 2nd problem and that problem can bleed your wallet over time.I really want to like this tablet because I feel like it's a great budget tablet, but when you look at the hidden costs (rooting + chargers) I'd almost be inclined to pay a little extra for something like a Kindle.In sum, it's not bad once you overcome the OS problem, but the charger will keep it from being great.  Perhaps the newer models addressed that, but on this model I'd advise to seek other options.",Very mixed feelings on this tablet,"3,4"

Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says \Nook\Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a \Nook\ is not required, it should say, \Not intended for Nook Devices\. Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to \DeskTop Study\ using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.",Not for Students and Professors,"3,4"

They could lose the unit etc. I loaded my credit card information to test the unit. After deciding to return the unit I talked to customer service about deleting my account information.

Not only is the touch screen quite easy to navigate (not to mention the fun of colour covers), but the e-ink pages are incredibly easy to read.  I can up the font size so that I don't need my reading glasses, which is a blessing.MOST important to me was the fact that the Nook supports ePub, which means I can use it at any library and at Project Gutenberg. I can take advantage of the Lend Me feature and, most importantly, B&N;'s motto for the reader doesn't seem to include the word \buy\ at every turn.For a woman in her late 50's with aging eyes, the Nook is a godsend!",Best E-Reader Available,1

1311,1520,"I bought a nook about 8 months ago. I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute \Your battery is too low to operate\ message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting \WHY, WHY, WHY\ every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.","Save your money, or 10 reasons the nook is awful","3,4"

B&N replaced both my husband's defective Nooks but not without difficulty.  Customer Support seems to be in India and representatives are difficult to understand.  Help depends upon whether or not you manage to connect with a customer service rep who is knowledgeable.  WARNING: You CANNOT change an email address in your B&N account if you have an early version Nook (no idea what \early version\ really means) without first unregistering your Nook.  NOWHERE could I find this information on the B&N website and one would logically think that email address and password are part of one's account profile since that's where one manages those items.  Not true - you MUST unregister your Nook, THEN change your email address and/or password.  (Password seems to be able to be changed without unregistering/reregistering the Nook.)  I just spent over an hour on the telephone with multiple Customer Service reps, having been cut off at least once, before I was able to successfully unregister and reregister my Nook with a new email address and password, having been forced to change it to thwart a hacker.  Of course B&N thanks you for your concerns and apologies for your inconvenience but in light of the various problems we've had I'd recommend buying a Kindle.

2376,1539,"I've owned this original Nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it.  I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into \going green\ driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.

106,1542,"Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader (WiFi only) [ Black & White]After a week and a half of playing with my new nook, and reading two novels on it, I decided to return it for a refund.  I found the reading experience much less pleasurable than a paper book.  The screen contrast is too low to read in low-light situations, the page turning mechanism is clunky, the page has an annoying way of flashing at every page turn, and the tactile experience is just not satisfying.The deciding factor, however, was the problem I had with connectivity.  The nook would not connect to wireless hotspots in several of my favorite coffee shops, and I found it impossible to transfer ebooks from my iBook.  I spoke with the experts at Barnes & Noble, who told me that the nook works better with some hotspots than others, and that yes, there can be compatibility problems with Macs.  In the end, I was reduced to using the nook to buy ebooks at my local Barnes & Noble store, where I discovered that seemingly all of the million-plus free books are OCR translations that have not been proofed.

2380,1579,"The Nook is probably o.k. if you use it just to buy stuff from Barnes and Noble, but it was sold to me as a tool for reading free books and it didn't work for that.After checking with the store (and getting a demonstration) to make sure it could be used this way, I purchased a Nook as a gift for my husband (an electrical engineer).  He couldn't to get it to work properly after he bought a book online.  He made numerous trips to a Barnes and Noble retail store where no one helped.  Finally, after going back yet again to see the Nook \expert\ they made some software upgrades and it sort of worked.  He was so dissatisfied that he was ready to throw it out.  So I said I would take it.  I then had a similar experience--trips back to B&N;, nice staff who tried to help but couldn't and a dysfunctional product. At my last visit, I was told that if they were really going to help me I needed to bring it in WITH my computer. I use a desktop for my downloaded books.I still have the receipt, but they won't let me return it because the various efforts we made to get it working took so long.  They say that the device isn't defective--it just doesn't really work.  It works much better in the store than at home.  I think they have a much faster wireless connection in the store, which explains why it seemed to work there, but it doesn't work with my desktop or our laptops via WiFi. Not only is it hard to download books, when I do download older books they are usually unreadable because of problems in rendering the .pdfs on the screen.I wasted another day trying to get library books to work--setting up accounts and files, tinkering with the settings etc.I finally gave up and got a Kindle DX. I downloaded and read an 18th-century text from Google Books within minutes of charging the Kindle. It is perfectly readable including the diagrams and plates.What I thought was a nice gift turned into a major headache for my husband and then for me. B&N; weren't honest with me about what it could do. Then they wouldn't let us return it. We have lost not only our money but all the time we spent driving back and forth to the retail store and getting no real help.",white elephant,"2,3"
2381,1587,"I hate the old ereaders on the market.  They were expensive, heavy and clumsy in my hand.  I didn't see how they were better than just a plain old book.  I LOVE this nook however.  I got it as a present from dear hubby.  It is light, so nice in my hand and fits great in my purse.  I love how you can make the font big.  I can read so much faster not squinting on small type.  Bonus is the books are cheaper too!!",Recent ereading convert,1
2382,1588,"This was my first e-reader, and remains my favorite.  I am a huge fan of e-ink, and enjoy the look of reading from paper.  It is very simple to use, and books can be easily side-loaded with the free Calibre software.  Page turn time is quick, but quicker with the newer version.  Battery life does last about two weeks, reading a pace of at least one to two hours per day.  Battery is only consumed when the color screen is on or when pages are turned.Of course, as a Prime customer, I really need a Kindle :)","Very good, basic Epub Reader","1,4"
2383,1589,"My journey towards owning a nook took kind of a strange path. I'd been excited to an e-reader, and when I was asked what I wanted for the holidays, my immediate response was a Kindle. I hadn't done any research, knew nothing about it other than it was the only e-reader I had heard of due to commercials, conversations, etc.When I received my Kindle, I immediately fell in love. I purchased several books using an Amazon Gift Card and carried it everywhere I went. It was the perfect size, the screen was clear and crisp, and it took seconds to set up. I had heard that my local library had a lending library of eBooks, and day after receiving my Kindle I raced over there to renew my library card. That was where my love affair with my Kindle began to fray.After getting my first book via email, I set about working to get it on my Kindle. Needless to say, this led to hours of frustration. I scoured the internet looking for a way to make it work, to get this ePub book to read on my Kindle. After an exhaustive search, I determined that without breaking dozens of international copyright laws are instantly learning how to hack or re-write script. I learned how proprietary the device truly was. In fact, if I wanted to read anything, I would have to purchase it from the Kindle store on Amazon.com.  It was with a heavy heart that I deleted all my purchases from my Kindle, packaged it back up, and sent it back to Amazon. To their credit, Amazon's customer service made the return process extremely easy. Within days I had my complete refund, including for the books I had purchased.Enter the nook. During my research, I had learned that the nook had the capability to do all the things the Kindle had lacked. It was specifically listed on my library's site as a capable e-reader, and allowed me the flexibility of purchasing from other sites, lending books to friends, or previewing books in store. I found a seller on Amazon who was offering the nook for its expected price of $149, not the ridiculous mark-up some of the vendors on this site are asking (in some cases $180???).the seller shipped the device quickly, and it arrived in the prompt fashion we have come to expect of Amazon purchases.I am very, very happy with my choice. While the nook is slightly larger, and perhaps a bit heavier, it performs like a champ. The e-ink screen has the same clarity and crispness of the Kindle, and the page turning feels sharp and quick, no different than flicking a page in its ink and paper counterparts. Setup was quick and easy,  I was able to connect to my WEP-encrypted Wireless network within seconds. I already had a B&N; account, so registration was a breeze, and my first book purchase was quick and easy as well. You have the option of purchasing from the site on your PC or perusing the store right on your nook, and the books arrive within seconds. The reading experience is fantastic, my love of reading ha been renewed after years of growing stale while reading and re-reading the covers on my bookshelves at home. I recommend a cover, of which Barnes and Noble offers a myriad of choices for both practicality and style.The only cons towards the nook that I have discovered thus far:1) The touchscreen, unlike the e-ink screen, has a glossy finish. It took a little getting used to the first time I read my nook. There can be a slight glare, and I recommend setting the touchscreen time out to 10 seconds. After just a few hours of reading, however, I forgot it was even there. I use a book light at night, and all it took was setting up the light so that it didn't reflect off the touch screen.2) The touchscreen is also not what we have come to expect with the advent and popularity of devices like the iPhone and Android. It can be slower than we are used to, but if you got this device primarily for reading as I did, this will be a minor annoyance.And thats really the only downsides I have been able to find thus far. Its also exciting having a brick and mortar storefront to visit with my nook. My first visit to the store with it, I was able to get a free smoothie from the cafe using a coupon from the screen. In fact there are several offers from the store page, including discounts and other offers. Add to this you can read for free in the store, and it just makes for a great experience all around. I stepped into the store, turned on my Nook, and it instantly welcomed me into the store, connecting instantly to their local network and filling me in on current offers.While the Kindle may be the more talked about e-reader, the smart choice is the nook. Until Amazon lifts the proprietary restrictions, the Kindle will always be an extraordinary device with ridiculous limitations on its capabilities. Go with the nook, you'll be happier in the long run.",The Smartest Choice.,"1,3,4"
2384,1602,"First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called \LendMe\. This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.","Great Item, But Does Have a Few Flaws","1,3,4"

1318,1612,"The Barnes and Noble customer service for the Nook is the worst customer service I have ever experienced to a tech product. The hold time can be 45 minutes or more and are prone to disconnects.  The problem is not assigned a case number so that when it is not solved and you need to call back you must start again with the new customer service person. The tech was unable to email me a temporary password and tried to blame this on my Mac email account even tough I could send and receive email from others. Basically they could not unlock my Nook so I can not buy books online.  The customer service reps are not fully trained in the vocabulary used on the NOOK screens and the pop up boxes on the Nook that indicate problems block the information needed by the techs to try and solve the problem.Technical support could not solve a simple password issue, I certainly won't keep this Nook out  of fear of a more sizable problem in the future.

2386,1634,"I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the \loop\ on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to \root\ the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.",Very nice eReader with tablet functionality,"1,4"
112,1635,"E-reader works well, although I've flashed it with a custom rom.Kindle app works well with custom android, but because I live in europe I haven't been able to install the nook application.The tablet is a bit on the slow side, but workable, the cpu inside isn't as quick as one of the more recent tablets.But I enjoy using it as an e-reader, which is why I bought it in the first place.",Good ereader and tablet,"1,3"
1320,1636,"I spent a month trying to decide what e-Reader to get, and I'm happy I decided on this model for the following reasons:1. I can use it it to display my portfolio (I'm an artist who didn't want to spend $500 on an iPad and wanted something that fit in my purse).2. The Nook Color is the only e-Reader you can read in the dark without a book light. This is VERY handy when you want to read discretely. (Such as at a teacher inservice...) All you do is set the background to \night\ (black), then lower the brightness, and you don't have that glow that shows you're up to something. (I got many jealous looks from other teachers.)3. If I have a problem with it, (which I did; the software was outdated), you get to work with REAL PEOPLE! All you have to do is take it into your nearest Barnes and Noble and they'll work on it--and it didn't take long and they were very friendly.4. The touch screen was easier to navigate than the Kindle when I tested it out against a Kindle at a Wal-Mart.Basically, with a Nook Color, you're getting an eReader that can do everything a tablet can except create documents. (It doesn't run MS Office, etc.) But you can listen to music, watch videos, play games, store and display photos, and of course, read books and documents.Now the only downside:1. The battery life is only good for about 8 hours. But who has time to read for more than 8 hours a day? I know I don't so I just plug it in every-other day before bed.2. The LCD screen does have a glare. (This, however, can be minimized by increasing the brightness when in bright light--so not really much of a problem.)I will tip my hat to the Kindle and I think that if I get a second e-Reader that has a longer battery life, I'd like to get the Kindle with 3G/WiFi.",Great for Artists!

The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)

If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen. So now we fight over it. Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way.

2392,1692,"I was looking for an e-reader/tablet for my wife and purchased this one for her for Valentine's Day.I initially avoided purchasing the Amazon Kindle Fire because the reviews online revealed the company's draconian practice of preventing custom software from being downloaded (or modifying existing software) on it. Amazon essentially controls your device, and how you use it, after you pay your money and take it home. You can read the Kindle's reviews (Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\ Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi) for yourself; many customers have even had purchased books removed from their devices' libraries, against their will, with little or no explanation. Coupled with reviews of cheap, low-grade hardware, it was an easy decision to dismiss Amazon's option.I had read many reviews that touted the Nook Color as a \tablet-killer\ and, unlike Amazon, had embraced the hacker-spirit and all but condoned the practice of downloading custom software onto the device. Full functionality of a mobile Android tablet WAS available on the Nook Color for a period of time (under the 1.4.0 software version). When I read the online reviews and purchased the device, I was unaware that there had been a very-recent software update. It seemed like a great deal at $200 versus the leading, reasonably-priced ($400) Android tablet, theASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet (Dock Sold Separately)or the leading, unreasonably-priced ($499)Apple iPad 2  Tablet (16GB, Wifi,) NEWEST MODEL... Unfortunately, Barnes & Noble was not as passive as it was, simply, very slow in implementing their own freedom-killing practices. While there are many tutorials and reviews praising the liberating options available to Nook customers on the old software (v. 1.4.0), the most recent software version (1.4.1) effectively killed the choice to customize the software, install Android Honeycomb (or other OS's), or make your purchase your own property.Now I'm stuck with a Nook e-reader, as opposed to the DIY Nook tablet that I had intended the device to be. The \solution\  seems to be adding extra software onto the modified Nook to block OTA (over-the-air) updates from automatically installing; but, I don't think the option to block all future updates is in my device's best interests and I would rather not have to battle with Barnes and Noble just to make MY DEVICE actually do what I want. Personally, I think Barnes & Noble made a huge mistake and sealed their fate as losers in the war against Amazon by their decision to follow Amazon's lead in limiting customers' rights to modify their own property. I don't know why companies choose to do this, or expect customers not to retaliate.I will be returning the Nook and purchasing the Asus Eee tablet. If, financially, you are stuck choosing between the Nook or the Fire, I would definitely recommend the Amazon Kindle Fire. As of the latest software versions, the functionality between the two devices is now exactly the same at the exact same price ($200). The Nook's hardware is, supposedly, slightly better; however, Amazon's clout in the industry more than makes up for any small differences. As an Amazon Prime member, there are also tons of freebies and benefits in choosing the Fire. Amazon's library of media also exceeds Barnes & Noble's in every area (more books, more movies, more apps, etc); being allowed to only purchase electronic media from Barnes & Noble is just not a good option and provides ZERO ADVANTAGE over purchasing media directly from Amazon.",Beware Of Software Version 1.4.1,"2,3,4"
2393,1694,"I looked around for the best eReader as I would be spending a lot of money investing into it. I thought the nookColor was a good choice. I was wrong. The battery life only last 6-8hours. When I went to charge it since it didnt last long every hour it only charged 10-13%. It took me almost 10 hrs to charge. Not cool. I did however like the fact its a touch screen, but.. not having the buttons on the side to turn the pages was annoying. All I did was tap the screen lightly and the page turned, at times it would turn and I didnt want it too. My BIGGEST problem was the screen was too bright. I am the type of person who likes to read before I go to bed. I had my nightstand lamp on, the screen brightness turned all the way down and it was still to bright for me. It made me really sick. Also, it doesnt have 3G so if I am somewhere with no Wi-Fi I couldnt download a book. Big bummer there. so... Its a great idea being in color. I really wanted it to work, but wasnt for me. I ended up returning it for the nook 3G. Its perfect. who needs color.",Too bright for the eyes,"2,3"

(It works great in any light, even sunlight, but not at the beach) Books are awesome to read. The screen is a little recessed so you get a cool different feel. The web browser is not speedy. (I would not recommend this product as a replacement for a tablet.) Magazines are a bit wierd on a 7 inch screen but it seems to do well for comic books.  All in all if you want a color ebook for reading the paper,comics, or books in general this is a cheap, great buy.Barnes & Noble NOOK Color eBook",Barnes and Noble NOOK Color eBook,"1,3,4"
2395,1708,"The reviews so far are really good, so I dont need to add more on the actual features. Now did you know that buying directly from B & N, the Nookcolor is actually $249? Also, for those who are concerned about the lcd, dont worry. You can adjust the brightness level. I lower it when I read at night in the dark, and when its daylight and I want more clarity, I can brighten it. You can use literature published in so many digital formats (but not amazon kindle format, which doesnt play well with others), and its just a pleasure to use. Someone mentioned that when you have it plugged for charging and try to type on the keyboard, it doubles the characters. Yeah, been there, done that, true story, so hopefully as they update the software, that will improve, but once you unplug, everything seems to work very nicely. If you want a nice reading environment, I really would recommend the nook color. It makes reading such a pleasure, at a very decent price for the product you are buying. I actually like that it has a tiny bit of \weight\ to it. Now my little droid incredible, which had been my reader til I got the NookColor, feels so...light! Almost TOO light! And...it LOOKS so elegant. I actually prefer having the plastic/metal (not sure what it is actually, but it feels nice and looks nicer) bezel as opposed to the ipad glass to the edge type construction. It gives me a nice place to put my fingers. And get a nice cover for it. B & N has some very nice ones. Yes, some are a bit pricey, but I really think its worth the investment. Mine already has fallen to the carpeted ground when my dog figured I had been reading long enough, and wanted some attention. I was very glad I had it in a cover. However, with the bezel and the rubberized back, I dont think I would have had a heart attack if it fell uncovered. I would never risk that, but it looks and feels as though it could take a bit of a tumble without much trouble, at least onto carpet. It just seems less fragile than the ipad or galaxy tab.  The book collections are extensive, and I also had quite a collection of pdf books which I very easily downloaded. And I LOVE the free trial for the magazines. To discontinue any of them you decide you dont want, you have to log into your online nook account on the B $ N website, and find the \manage subscriptions\ link. Took me a minute to figure that out, so hopefully that tidbit will save you some frustration. But overall, its a wonderful, colorful, very nice user experience. Its an ereader first and foremost, and it does that very well. It just happens to have a few lil extra goodies tossed in to boot! Dont compare it to the ipad. It isnt supposed to BE the ipad! Let it have its own little niche, and I promise you will be as happy with it as I am!",Awesome product!,"1,4"

2397,1738,"I honestly wish I had never come across this. The Nook itself was a gift (thank goodness) but I've pored tons of into it in the form of cases, apps, books and magazine subscriptions. Now I am trying to find a place that will give me more than $20 for the parts. A sampling of the problems with the Nook Color.1. The screen is backlit and incredibly bright. Even on the dimmest setting, I am rubbing my eyes within twenty minutes. I can't read this for extended periods without getting a migraine.2. One of the major appeals of an E-book for me was cheaper books, as there are obviously significantly decreased costs of production. Titles on the Nook are extremely expensive. I compared it to Kindle prices, and the Nook's were always noticeably more expensive. The cases are pure highway robbery ($35 for a case in store).3. Customer service. They brag one of the main advantages of Nook over Kindle is the customer service. This is false. The people working the Nook booth in my local B&N; have never been too helpful, and I don't like having to drive 15 minutes to a store to ask a basic question. However, whenever I call, there is a long wait time and I never can communicate well with the person on the other end.4. Deceptive advertising. The Barnes&Noble; ad campaigns heavily feature the fact that the Nook Color and HD can play movies, marketing is an alternative to Kindle Fire. The Kindle can download almost any movie from Amazon Instant and stream anytime and anywhere without taking up much memory. Nook can sometimes load Netflix when you had an excellent Wifi connection. When I do have an excellent Wifi connection (like at home) I am going to watch movies on my TV or laptop, not E-reader. The only times I would want to watch movies on my E-reader are say, on vacation or on a long bus ride... when I do not have an excellent Wifi connection. The feature is deceptive and pointless.5. The final straw for me was the magazine system. I have used only a fraction of my Nook's memory, but to save space, the Nook automatically deletes my old magazine issues. If I want to access them again, I have to re-download them, a slow and pain-staking process. And then, within a day, Nook has deleted them all again. When I asked Nook support about this (if I bought those magazines I should have the right to do with them what I'd like) there was practically no response.THIS IS AMAZON.

I contacted customer service and made it clear that Amazon has 95% of the ebooks I would like to read, while they have ALMOST NONE.I asked what they were doing to increase their selection. They assured me that they were getting new books all of the time and to check back frequently.The bottom line is that B&N;'s selection of ebooks PALES in comparison to Amazon's, and it seems they are either too arrogant or apathetic to do something about it.I am also curious how B&N; knows WHICH books customers want if there is no format to REQUEST that books be formatted for ereaders. In contrast, Amazon has an easy-to-use request button so consumers can voice themselves and in so doing, influence the market.

121,1749,"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.","Heavy, slow, poor screen, buggy","2,3"
1327,1751,"I should preface this by saying I also own a nook (non color 3g) and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an e-reader it was a tough choice to pick B&N; over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store, living down the street from a B&N; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.",Nook for an Amazon Lover?!,1

2402,1800,"Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the \read to me\ feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the \finger pinch\ method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the \Article View\ feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a \read-only\ experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  \Lend Me\ is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!",Just what I've been waiting for!!,"1,3,4"

2404,1808,"I should preface this review by stating that I'm predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky, but do appreciate good industrial and UI design.The NC is really a great color eReader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific, Android based tablet.  BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.

127,1809,"I did my research on ebook readers well before Christmas 2010 as I decided that is what I wanted. :) That research led me to the NookColor which hadn't been released yet- but I was sold on it. Santa was kind enough to leave it under my tree and I've been loving it ever since.Here's why:-The weight of the reader is perfect and the size of the reader and the screen are proportionate to each other.-I love being able to read magazines on my NookColor for the fraction of the cost- in COLOR.-I love that my 19 month old daughter can interact with her favorite children's books both at home and on the go- in COLOR.-IMO there is no need for 3g- it serves no purpose. Once you download your media via the internet/wifi, it's there for you to access wherever you are. NookColor gets two thumbs up for this!-Being able to highlight passages, words etc and come back to them is a fantastic feature as is the ability to look up a words definition via wifi.-NookColor is user friendly and has a great interface; the screen color is clean, clear and crisp.Facebook has a NookColor page where you can go and find other NookColor users who are willing to lend you books and are interested in being lent books, so there's no need to literally know a fellow Nook owner.ALSO- someone mentioned you CANNOT use a Barnes and Noble Gift Card to purchase eBooks- THIS IS INCORRECT. All you have to do is log on to B&N.com; and add your gift card to your account. Once you do that, whatever purchases you make on your NookColor, the price comes off the GC until it is empty and then your CC is charged. Very simple.All in all, this is a great e-reader. The price is right for all of the amazing features it offers and the available accessories make it easy to customize your Nook!",Best of the best! Doesn't get better than this!,1

We rooted them to turn them into a great little tablet before the tablet came out.My only complaint is the charging cable. The metal connector is VERY flimsy and easily bent. Don't read with it plugged in and be careful how you have the device sitting while charging. One bump can break it and they won't replace it unless it's under warranty despite everyone complaining it is badly designed.Don't expect much help in the stores, either.

129,1833,"I love reading but hate carrying books around in my bag, they end up with pages bent or dirty from accidental spills. I bought my nook color in an attempt to make part of my extensive library portable when I was riding the bus and I fell in love with it. The responsive, bright screen, the endless customization, the ability to have some android apps to help when I just cant read anymore all quickly helped make my nook one of my favorite electronics. One charge seems to last forever even with heavy usage.  I've kept it in a purple cover I got from B&N and after approx. a year, the nook looks brand new. (Although I would stay away from their purple fabric cover, beautiful but gets dirty SO easily) I absolutely love  my nook color. There are a few minor glitches, it has a tendency to be a little unresponsive if you have too much on it and the web browser isn't so great. The only major problem I've had with it is the fact that the ability to hi-light is unpredictable and difficult. That is why I'm selling mine to upgrade to an Ipad. I recently started taking courses and need something I can underline/hi-light/take notes on, and while the Nook Color is an EXTRAORDINARY e-reader, it was not created for either of those purposes. If what you are looking for is a color e-reader that is comfortable in the hand, with a bright screen and will use it primarily for *reading* then this is a great investment!",My First E-Reader & I'm Hooked,"1,3"

I'm using the link B&N; put on my bookmarks.Other than that though, its awesome. It works really well & haven't had any trouble with any ebooks....however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked up/down instead of sideways like regular books.UPDATE:After playing with it a little longer, I got things going better. My youtube videos all work fine and I love it even more now.I have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since I was trying to find one I liked (such as Sony Touch, kindle and a few others which are all newest models) and my NookColor is my absolute favorite!A few problems that I hope may be fixed with future updates is when I visit certain pages (ex: google.com) & tap a text box to type something in, my keyboard will dissappear & I have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear.The other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way.In any case, I still LOVE it.

I wanted to make sure what I write will help others.  Take this device for what it is....a e-reader and not a tablet.  I love it for reading ebooks and emagazines.  A perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers open.The color of photos are amazing and beautiful.  I can view just about any website, but not videos from flash.  Again this is not a tablet. But I can view many Youtube videos.  I have downloaded my own photos and they look great.I cannot open my emails from my carrier (comcast), not sure why. The website...but not the individual emails from my contacts.The touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes I end up having to do things twice.I gave my review four stars only...because of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreen.Overall I do love the size and the many things you can do with the NookColor.FYI...I typed this review on my NookColor...",GENIUS!!....for only $249.00,"2,4"

2409,1871,"Although the nook color offers the ability to browse the internet, watch streaming video (netflix), and play games, in the end it is really just an eReader.  The video is very choppy for watching streaming video.  No one likes watching a netflix movie with a bunch of squares on the screen.  Barnes and Noble has its own OS, therefore many of the games that are free in the android market cost on the nook color (specifically angry birds).In the end, if you want this to play some games (free or those you are willing to play) this would be okay.  Especially since you can add an Micro SD card to expand the memory available.  But, if you want to get this for someone who will watch netflix on it...or use it for really anything other than an eReader, I would think twice about not just getting a tablet.  The cost isn't that much and the reward is great.  Plus, tablets can read eBooks just as well.",Just an eReader,"1,3,4"

(I am a senior citizen).  My daughter & grandson gave me this Nook color for my birthday.  In spite of my previous objections, I quickly fell in love with it.  It is light weight and easily toted in my purse.  I can make the text as big as I need and adjust the background lighting, so that I seldom need my reading glasses. (That's a plus, right there!).  I can even read in bed, without distrubing my husband and turning on the light.  That's right! I can read in the dark! (although, I try to keep that to a minimum, because even though I am able to do it...it still feels like it's something I shouldn't be doing).  Most of the genre of books I like to read are free or less than a couple of dollars!  I can also use my Nook to \borrow\ from the library.Another thing I love about my Nook is that I can check my Facebook account, and respond pretty easily--just have to get accustomed to the touch of the \very sensitive\ keyboard.  I am also able to check my email and Google calendar.Well, keeping in mind that I have nothing to compare it to; and realizing that this is like the discovery of an electric can-opener, for me--I have to say that I LOVE my Nook Color!

133,1925,"Even though our first pre-owned Nook came with some issues, they were quickly taken care of by the B&N; customer service department. We were the most impressed with the fact CS is located in America with English speaking reps who we could actually understand!The Nook Color is a lot more than a book reader. Frankly we wouldn't have bought it if that was all it was. Since the Nook is built on an Android platform there are a few thousand apps to keep you busy between books. The screen colors are very crisp and the video is blu ray quality. We haven't owned either of ours long, but we haven't had to charge the battery yet. It has a very long life.Since we don't own a smartphone, the Nook is the next best thing. Apart from not being able to take a call with it, it will do most everything a smartphone will do without the $100 per month bill. We look forward to taking it on our long drives to use as a way of figuring out what is in the next town, checking gas prices and finding discount hotel rooms on the fly. It will save us a lot more than the purchase price.I'm sure we will find a lot more to do with the Nook over time. We are especially excited to use Netflix when it is released for the Nook. The only reason we gave it four stars instead of five is because there is always room for improvement. Maybe they will find a way to add a phone to it. Skype maybe?If I had one complaint it would be the sound quality.

I have two books that are unusable.  With the first book, I worked with their \online help\ five times before giving up.",Nook Color Technical Issues,2

More games and children's apps than anything else. Funny, there is no Facebook app.. It does play video and music, but not all videos are compatible. The battery runs down pretty fast so plan on charging every night if you use it regularly. Buying and downloading a book or magazine is very fast and easy from B & N, but you cannot go outside B & N for apps or books. That's obviously how they make money.

They told me that in fact the battery was non-replaceable and I could buy their extended warranty if I wanted to cover the battery for an additional 2 years after the one year manufacturers warranty. If my battery died after the warranty period was up, I was told they would not replace the battery. Basically I would have to buy a new unit.I took it back to Barnes and Noble and explained that I was not willing to throw $250.00 down the drain because they wouldn't replace the battery at any point in the future. The sales people had no idea. They were under the impression that the Nook could be sent back ay any time for a replacement battery.

(1) we discovered first that there was less than a handful of apps available for the Nook compared to hundreds (if not thousands) for the Kindle.  (2) Those very few apps the Nook has are outdated and limited and, generally, overpriced.  (3) Next, we discovered that the books available for purchase via B&N; (which is essentially the only option to get books on to the device) are more expensive than their counterparts on other devices (Kindle, Sony Reader, etc.), (4) It's virtually impossible to download library books to the Nook.  There's a convoluted path you must take which sometimes work and sometimes doesn't~more often doesn't.

Searching for the best matching one, I've found 2 interesting: Barnes & Noble Nook Touch and Kobo Touch. My decision was based on the page-turning knobs implemented in the shell, which were lacking in Kobo device. I'm quite happy with Nook Touch, allthough don't really understand the politics behind the sale of the electronic books outside of North America. It's simply impossible to buy smething from NB, not having an adress in States or Canada. DRM coded books can be readed, but without the cover image - probably software issue. Few times, while pressing over the word, which of course highlighted the marking (without choosing any options) it went out of response from the touch screen. The only solution was, either to plug the USB cable, or wait until the device can be accessed - meaning at least one hour.Well, as a gift for my doughter, Nook Touch is perfect, small, light and stylish.

I wasted three entire days on the phone (my Christmas holiday) with customer service in some foreign country and they never could get the Wi-fi running. They had no clue. None of them. All they wanted to do was get off the phone with me so they could NOT help someone else. They kept telling me to take the Nook to the nearest store, which was two hours away. So I took it to the B&N store and they said, yeah, we get a lot of that. Needless to say, they couldn't help me. I couldn't get my money back either. Just four Gift Cards. Do Not Buy A Nook.

2424,2070,"Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country.The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N;'s ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.",Reach out and Touch someone,"1,3,4"

It supports traditional epub, pdf, jpeg and to my surprise, it reads MS Office doc and docx files without any issue. The screen is way better and more gentle with the eye, than any kindle device. It's the fastest reader so fast. The only limitations are: a) the fact you can only use wifi to buy from the barnes and noble sotre. b) despite the kindle, it reads no mp3, and has no text to speech function.

1351,2124,"nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader, weather sony or nook. this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader, while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader . Dont move an ebook, instead copy the ebook on the ereader & retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory, just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books, and nook has a really bright white screen ,like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi &#34;on&#34;,nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge, with wi fi off ,battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook, but only when they are side by side,my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader -prs 300-is less than 1/2 price of nook, but has no wi-fi & only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once, so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books. sony's battery needs recharge thru usb cord every 2 weeks.but the sony can change from portriat to landscape orentation, so i can hold my sony ereader sideways, when i read in bed,on my back  with the ereader held up over my head. My nook cant do this.sony prs300 works with .epub & .pdf & sony reader software that you download onto your computer. the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader. sony reader for your computer is a epub & pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library ,where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook,through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader - prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereader-prs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz, so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi - fi ,in-case i want to pay $12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wi-fi book, but i dont think so. the filthy rich would like the wi fi 12.99 book ,though.I thought that the nook touch screen would be cool , but it is kind of a pain the the butt because the nook changes pages when ever your finger gets even close to the screen, weather you want to change pages or not. 'So,you spend 30 % of you time ,just trying to find the page you were just on, 2 seconds ago.But,after a while,you get used to this and its not really an issue,even though it continues to occur.It's the price you pay for a touch screen.the nook works with .epub and .pfd books and adobe digital editions. You should downloadadobe digital editions from downloads/cnet.com  for free onto your computer and then download free internet books into your computer file that the internet puts them in and copy the file into adobe digital editions library. adobe lets you look at/read-- the book on your computer and see if you want to sideload it into your nook. adobe digital editions will recon-nize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook. this cable recharges the nook battery and at the same time allows you to download .epub and .pdf ebooks & files into you nook.WHAT I REALLY HATE ABOUT THE NOOK  is you cant delete just 1 book or just 20 books,you have no choice,you must delete all the books on the nook.Because of this,backup on to your computer any book you download into nook, as you cant retrieve anything from nook. You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books. You wont have to delete it all and start over for a long time .nook requires you go to barnes & noble to open an account & register the nook before nook will work. The B&N; salespeople will do it 4 you, or you can do it yourself,if you like to read & follow instructions. When you delete nook , you have to reregister nook at barnes & noble all over again.most people will be out of range of B&N; wi-fi ,so you wont be able to register nook without a trip to B&N; to get in range of the wi fi.","my nook ,a love/hate thing,compair nook to sony ereader as i own both.","2,3"

2432,2154,"Just a short review of my two weeks with the Nook Simple Touch.  This looked the the reader to get when it came out.  Specifically for me the touch screen was a must.  I enjoyed reading on it everyday until I returned it.  It was light and extremely easy to navigate with its touch screen.  What happened though, was on about the 12th day while using it the touch screen stopped responding.  I couldn't turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.  And, when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldn't swipe the screen to get into the book - I was completely stuck...locked out.  Finally after fiddling with it after about 15 minutes it started to work again.  I went on the web and found out that others had this same thing happen to them so I decided to return it rather then hope for a fix (I was still within my 14 days return policy).","Good reader, has some problems.","2, 3"

Another thing that makes a tablet goood is ( please not im doing this from a Kindle Fire point of a view ) that you can have apps , books , music and videos . Does the Nook allow any of this ? Nope except the book part . It is also very weak . You stop using it and you must charge it . I hope my review keeps everybody away from this tablet ( opps ).

The NOOK is lighter and more convenient to carry around than the KINDLE - my wife crocheted a nice neat carry bag for mine.

I know Amazon won't let me list prices, but at the time I'm writing this the current \list price\ is 40% higher than the actual in-store price.  Even with Amazon's current discount, it's higher.  Buying at the store also gives you the opportunity to purchase the extended warranty, which protects your NOOK from drops and liquid spills, etc, for two years.  You can take it directly into a store to get it fixed, you don't have to mail it out to Amazon or anything.Otherwise this is a fantastic little e-reader.  The interface is incredibly Simple(ha) and the e-ink is easy to read.  You can change text size to make any book a large-print book, and buying books through Wi-Fi is a snap.

The product itself is faulty, and the customer service and return policies are very poor.My mother loved her Nook Color so much, she offered to buy me either the Color or the Touch.  I went with the Touch, thought something simpler would be nice, since I work around computers all day.  I was wrong.  Within the first 20 days, my Nook started to devour battery power.  I was told when I bought it I had 30 days to return it for a new one, but apparently, they changed that.  I was offered a refurbished product to replace a brand new one, which I thought was really cheap of them, and not good customer service.  Then, I was told it was a software issue, and would be resolved soon, so I held on to my Nook.  One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.  I was told to call the warrenty dept, but that was a wasted call - they only repeated what had already been said, and also pointed out I'd now had the unit for 90 days.

It's a pleasure to read on this thing.The Not so Good StuffNot sharing on sideloaded content. If I sideload a book from other store, the sharing option gets unavailable.Not that many formats. Just Pubs and PDF. I mostly read Pub files, but it would be great if they support other formats too.Not \send to\ option. In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless. This thing doesn't have a feature like that, so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.Overall a great product, I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read, better ergonomics, and the UI makes it feel a lot better.","Simple, Lightweight and Great UI","1,3"

How it compares to the kindle, I dunno I seen raves and complaints for both.For an ereader I love the nook.- battery life is awesome.  would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators.- the display looks great, even in direct sunlight more or less.- The simple touch looks cool, very simplistic. no buttons all touchscreen for the most part.- The extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.covers anytype of damage from what I understand.- Not as many CCNA/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast.- No addswhat I dont like;- only comes with 200mb of internal memory.  You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it. Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.",No delete options??,"1,3,4"

2448,2331,"I've had a nook for almost a year now and I spend all my time trying to download files, renew books from the library (the only lend for two weeks), and mess with files that won't open for whatever reason.  Then I have no time left to actually read anything and I'm left frustrated and annoyed.  E-readers seem great in theory, but are a nightmare in practice.  I guess I can't speak for the kindle, but using our Nook to borrow from libraries has been a total waste of time.  Do yourself a favor and stick to the printed books.  No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.  All the copyright protection surrounding e-books makes them absolutely a horrible value for the money you spend and a waste of time on top of it all.  And when you leave your e-reader in the taxi, at the restaurant, or some opportunistic thief snatches it when your not looking, you are out $100.  What thief would target your $6 paperback?  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.",E-readers are a waste of time,"2,3"
1358,2334,"I'm a bit of an android fan, so when the nook product line was first announced, I was onboard (I skipped the kindle because I didn't want a big keyboard cluttering up the space). I got it at launch, and used it frequently. Then... the iPad came out, and I found that when the B&N; eReader app came out, I was bringing my nook with me less, because, hey, I could just use the iPad to read, right? Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.) worked just as well? So I sold the nook.Then a funny thing happened. I stopped reading as much. See, with the iPad I was watching videos, playing games, messing around with apps, etc. Which is great, but I just ended up opening things other than the eReader app. At the time this dawned on me, I immediately thought \If only there was a smaller form factor for the nook, I'd probably take that with me more, and start reading again...\Enter the nook touch. It's much smaller, much lighter, and ditches the color touchscreen (which was frankly always a bit of a pain) at the bottom of the device. What you're left with is a lean, mean, reading machine. It's not without its flaws. I'm not going to touch on the platform itself (the original nook and nookColor reviews cover that pretty extensively), but I did want to talk about some of the differences from the eyes of an original nook owner.Even for a techie like me, I struggled with the interface at first, so here's a few items of note:The Good/Notable:- You can both tap the screen on the left or right side (left meaning page back, right meaning page forward) OR swipe left/right to turn pages.- Additionally there's buttons under the rubber on the left and right side of the front of the device. This has been an absolute boon for one-handed reading, which happens constantly for me with a device so light. Switching hands still gives me the power to paginate without having to change back.- Overall, the speed/snappiness of the device blows away the speed on the original nook + 1 update (i.e. the time when I ended up selling the nook). Page turning is near instant, the on/off speed and unlocking is far faster too. With one exception...The not-so-good:- The keyboard is pretty slow. Still. The infrared sensor that's used to detect touch requires a lot of patience and single-letter typing. This was really only an issue on initial setup for the wifi at my home. I honestly haven't used the keyboard in about a month. If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it. I had to run it down completely a few times and recharge before I started getting anything near the 1-month advertised time. It's more like 2-3 weeks now that it's baked in, but that beats the original nook I had, and honestly, if you can't be troubled to charge the thing overnight once every 3 weeks, I'm not sure what to say. Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface. For cheaper than the original nook.",An excellent improvement on the original nook.,"1,3"

161,2340,"I didn't order my Nook from Amazon but all I can say is, that it is AMAZING! This nook is for the people who are major readers like me. I mean I can rip through 3 - 5 books depending on the length. You have to think that I don't always buy the books, I check them out with my library's Overdrive. Its wonderful (though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions, which is completely safe, to manage your library books with you Nook).The down side is that it is not backlit. I like to read all day, and it kind of sucks that I'm not able to read in the dark without any additional accessories. The battery life is great. I charged it on Christmas night, and the charge is still over 85%.They could have made the power button a little easier to push because I have trouble telling if i have pushed it or not.

I did not like the dark screen/ contrast or glare from the sony and tried a Kindle. I would have loved it, if it worked. The wireless did not work in my area so back it went. By this time I ran across the nook at the local BN store. I decided to give it a go and I love it! I have not experienced any of the issues other people have had. I have had about 4 days and I am in love. I am glad I was able to try out the other ereaders as well. I love that it is so customizable with colored backs, very well made covers (got my kate spade pink cover) and the color screen is fun and gives it a splash of color on the monochrome screen. I love to view my books covers in color! I have added my own wallpapers and best of all I was able to move my sony books over to the nook via adobe digital editions. It was so very easy! Downloading books is a breeze, bookmarks work, pages turn quickly. In the end it is all about your personal preference but I am glad I ended up with a Nook!",Love it!,1
2457,2433,"I like the Nook's small fit in my hand. It's easy to operate-easy and fast to upload e-books. It's great on the eyes. Simple to add new wallpaper from your photo files. Some issues uploading music, but still working on this, but it nice that it does play music. Downloads were super fast and easy. I thought I would have some issues with the temporary \ghost\ on page turns, but after a couple of pages, it really didn't bother me. I am so accustomed to reading books with the \two-page\ view, that (for some reason) I thought it would seem weird. I actually found I read faster because I am only focusing on that text. Bookmarking is easy, and it's nice having all your books in one place. I like to read a couple of books at a time. Having them all in one place is very convenient. I actually purchased three book I just purchased, and gave the hardcopies to a friend who wanted them when I finished. You can subscribe to daily papers (New York Times, etc) and get it downloaded daily for a small monthly fee. I don't watch TV, but I am close to abandoning the computer to catch up on reading. Also, it worth reading Dave Barry's piece about the Nook when you first \crack\ open your Nook-it's \laugh-snort\ funny! Like all e-readers, the Nook is not backlit, so you will need to buy an external light source (some kind of clip-on light) to read in dim or darken conditions. I also like the fact that you can prop it up on a pillow in bead and not have to reposition, or hold the Nook--just press the page button to turn and away you go!",New to e-readers,1

When I try to register, it gives me a c7851 error, a customer service number, and then a blank screen.  I can't even view the books I bought.The biggest disappointment is Customer Service.  I've called three times and they just keep saying they're sorry, the system is in maintenance, and there's nothing they can do. I should call back later in the day.  Then I should call in back 24 hours.  Now I should call back in 24-48 hours.It's going back tomorrow, and I'll get a Kindle.",How horrible.  I'm SO disappointed....,3
165,2440,"I had purchased a certified Pre-owned Nook because all of the reviews I had read had been top notch. There was not anything that I had heard that was too terrible about this E-reader and I had never had a problem with the service with Barnes and Noble before. Then I turned on my Nook after having it six months and the bottom left hand corner of the screen there is just a white spot and cannot see what is beneath it and it will not move. I contacted the customer service to see if it could be fixed and they gave me instructions and said to call back within 3 and a half hours after the charging period was finished if the problem was not corrected. If it was not corrected, I could have them give me instructions to send it back, at my cost, and if they deem it their problem they will fix it or send a new one, but if it is seen as my fault, then they will ship it back, at again my cost. The money does not seem worth it for all of the hassle it has given me. The pages turn slower than the Kindle and the ink is much lighter, plus the battery life is at least half as long. My cousin has a Kindle and that is the item that I am going to go with, it seems like the best solution.",I would go with the Kindle,2
1367,2441,"Ok, let me start by saying that I've had the Nook for about a week now, and I absolutely LOVE it!! I brought it to work the first day I got it and showed everyone, and they all wanted to go out and get one (actullay 1 of them did). Right out of the box I was able to start navigating the menus with ease.The e-ink technology is really cool.  It resembles a real book page.  The brighter the light, the better it looks, so outdoor reading is possible compared to a backlit screen that fades when you go outside.After reading many of the other reviews on here, you almost get the feeling that the Nook has many issues or problems.  I can tell you that none of those \issues\ have occured on my Nook.  Now I can tell you this, when I tried to dwnld my first book, it was having some issues.  It couldn't connect to the store, so after contacting customer service, the problem was quickly recognized and solved.  The problem was user error. When I registered my Nook, I typed my credit card # in wrong, and that's what caused the problem.  So make sure you enter your info in correctly to help avoid that error.  :)I was on the fence for a while about which e-reader to choose.  So I went to a B&N; and played with a Nook.  I was sold immediatly! Part of the reason was beacuse there happened to be a customer standing right next to me that had the Kindle 2 in his hand. I got to play with both and compare them at the same time.  The Kindle 2 was very nice, but just felt a little cheaper, not as solid-feeling like the Nook.  Plus the keyboard on the kindle leaves little room for you to hold it.  The Nook just felt so much better in my hand.  The screen navigating was much more simple too in comparison to the Kindle. The customer that had the Kindle was in the store to look at the Nook! He wasn't completely satisfied with the Kindle, so he was comparing them too!I can literally go on for days, but I do need to get back to work.  Get the Nook, you won't be sorry!",On the fence? Choose the Nook!!,1
1368,2442,"UPDATE:  v1.3 has been released, and OH MY GOODNESS...even better!  Now there's a web browser (beta version), games (Sudoku and Chess), better WI-FI (and its own separate button on the touchscreen, instead of having to go to Settings), \More in Store\ (where you can get special offers and maybe even a free cookie while you're in a Barnes & Noble store!) and \Read in Store\ (where you can read any ebook for free for up to an hour per book while you're in the store).  Owning a NOOK is getting better and better as time goes on.  And the thing is only a few months old!----------------------Battery life -- since the v1.2 software upgrade, it has been phenomenal.  Recommend leaving Airplane mode on except when you actually need connectivity (to purchase books, mainly).  You can always turn Airplane mode off overnight while charging so you can have your Daily updated by morning.Replaceable battery -- does the Kindle let you do that?  That's what I thought.Touchscreen -- love it.  Breaks the monotony of monotone.  But that's not why I love it so well.  I enjoy the swiping feature to turn pages.  Very cool, but also functional.  Arrows work, but swiping takes it to another usability level.  I also like the navigation process in the touchscreen.  Works well for me for getting around.  No, it's not like a mouse, but this is an ereader, not a laptop.  The virtual keyboard works fine for me, but I can see issues if you have double-wide fingers (smile), but just use your fingertips and you're fine.Lending -- don't think I'll use that too much because I don't have lots of friends or family with nooks to be able to do this with, but it's there and it's darn cool to have this as an OPTION.Borrowing ebooks from public libraries -- what's not to like about that???  You get to read current titles for FREE.  My library has a note that Amazon does not allow ebooks from the library to be read on Kindles...I'd be ticked about that if I owned a Kindle.Looks -- I'm a function over form guy most of the time, but sorry, the nook is MUCH better looking than a Kindle.  The form factor is just less cluttered and it feels solid and comfortably weighted.  There's a certain amount of trade-offs between real or virtual keyboards, but I much rather have the touchscreen than a Big Momma chicklet keyboard taking up all that real estate.More open ebook format options -- less DRM hassles.  Period.Expandable memory with microSD cards -- nice option.  (Although room for 1,500 books in on-board memory is mind-boggling as it is.)So...  I think the nook, that's all of one Christmas season old, and the Kindle, that has matured in the market for several years already now, are both amazing products.  But, no one can tell me the nook is not AS good as a Kindle or even better with some of its features.  In fact, I believe many of the issues people ran into with their nooks are not unlike issues that Kindle owners run into, especially when Kindle was only 3 months old way back when (like the nook).  And to be frank, many of the complaints that came forth prior to v1.2 and even now are because people REFUSE to read the manual or go to the help web sites or message boards that explain many of the fixes or get-arounds or instructions for the people who are allergic to reading those aforementioned manuals.",Fantastic e-reader.  Just love it.,1
166,2446,"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all.So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!",Product is useless/Customer Service at the store is priceless,2

169,2473,"I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The \paper-white\ display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The \5 day battery life\ in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...",Disappointing,"2,3"
2458,2477,"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!",Wow worth every bit!,1
1369,2480,"Received the Nook for my birthday. I love it! I never considered buying an ereader, but I have tried both the Kindle and the Nook before. I find the Kindle to be so functional and inelegant; its user interface is not intuitive at all. The Nook is so simple to use and the store is huge. I love it! Best ereader out there.",Fantastic!,1
2459,2483,"I originally gave this product a good review when it first came out.  But, this product is not all it seems to be when you first buy it.First, if you have an IPod Touch, IPad, iPhone, Droid  or any similar product AND are a casual reader....this device is already obsolete.The same B&N; required to download books through your Nook can be used through iPod and its Nook App, turning your device into a pocket-sized e-reader; better than lugging around the Nook, which is rather heavy and certainly can't slip in your pocket.  The \glare\ on the iPod, in particular, is non-existent once the brightness is turned down to its lowest setting.  Speaking of glare, the lack of backlight on the Nook has backfired on me several times and I had to buy a booklight for it eventually; buying a booklight for an ELECTRONIC device felt as ridiculous as it sounds.  Ultimately, between iPhones/Pods and androids, there are too many multi-functional  products, with better portability, on the market to blow $80-$200 on a device like this.",Practically Obsolete,"2,3"
2460,2486,"I have a Kindle and I am very happy with it, but I also wanted the Nook. Just as I don't see the need to choose between PC and Mac and just keep one of each around, I don't see that this is a fight that is necessary. There are a handful of books for Nook that I can't get on Kindle, and a bit more than a handful of books on Kindle I can't get on the Nook.The device is beautiful. I love the solid rubber backing. The aluminum backing on the Kindle sure looks nice but on a cold Colorado night I do prefer the rubber. It is really nice to see the book cover in full color and with the 1.2 update they just pushed out the device is just as snappy as I would want. Sure it's not going to win any speed contests, but it's supposed to be simulating a book. Not exactly a high speed sport. Page turns seem to be just the same or only very slightly slower than my Kindle 2.The free comedic articles in the Daily section are quite funny and the intersting things that pop up when you take it into a Barnes and Noble store are quite fun.I am disappointed in some of the ommisions from the book store though. EVE: The Empyrean Age and the JPS Student's Tanakh were two things that I have on my Kindle that I read often that are no where to be found on the Nook. In fact there are no Tanakhs at all for the Nook, but a good bakers dozen Christian Bibles. If I were more paranoid I'd probably be offended by that.I do like the fact that the nook can take ePub books though. I can always pop over to Diesel Books and purchase my missing books and transfer them straight over, which takes a bit of the sting out of the missing library.All in all I would recommend the Nook to anyone who lives near a Barnes and Noble. I am just not quite sure I could recommend it over and above the Kindle at the moment. Perhaps if and when they expand their book selection that could change.",Great Product - Missing Books,"1,3,4"

170,2489,"I'll start off by saying I don't own the nook but I've played around with it for a while along with the Kindle.  I'll say this about the Nook...the screen is immensely better than the Kindle.  Much, much easier to read and the pages \turn\ a lot faster.  It's still too slow for my tastes but I'm picky.  The touchscreen at the bottom really isn't all that useful, the Kindle interface wins on that account.  The biggest thing...don't buy this at amazon!  I don't know why they are selling it for $400 (I know, it's a third party vendor).  Best Buy has it for $250 so I'm not sure why people would buy it here.  I'd like the Nook screen with the larger Kindle size/interface...for $250 (I know, won't happen).  The whole ereader is still years away to getting to the point where I'd buy one.",Not bad at all,"1,3"
171,2496,"I've seen some negative reviews from people who purchased the Nook earlier this year (Jan/Feb), however, I just bought mine about a week ago and have had 0 problems with it.  My wife received hers as a Christmas gift and has never had a problem with it.  I upgraded immediately to firmware 1.3 (the newest version) which adds some games (yay for Sudoku!) as well as a web browser.  If you are looking for a mobile web device, stick to a smart phone or netbook as this is not it.  That's not a complaint as I never expected this to be a web browser for me, it's first and foremost an e-book reader, and it's a great one at that!The e-ink screen is amazing, and makes reading so much easier than an LCD screen (if you have to read a lot of PDFs for work I would buy one of these just for that!).  The other features on this are outstanding as well.  It reads a number of formats including epub and PDF, so you are not stuck only shopping for books from one source (i.e. the Kindle, iPad, and Sony e-reader).  It is also compatible with Adobe Digital Editions, so it's a snap to download a book from my local library and read it on my Nook.  It's also easy to lend books to other Nook users (so long as the book you have is LendMe(TM) compatible).  The media player works well, but only plays MP3s, so none of the songs you bought off of iTunes that is an M4P (i.e. DRM'd beyond use) will work - that's why I always recommend buying digital music from Amazon's MP3 store - great selection and prices, and NO DRM.  The sound quality from the speakers on the Nook is not so good (they're small and I didn't expect them to be top quality), but if you plug in some headphones it sounds great!I also like that it comes with three free books already pre-loaded (Dracula, Little Women, and Pride & Prejudice) and you can customize your background/screen saver with BMP, JPG, etc. pictures.  The only downside is that the battery life is not quite up to par with some of the other e-book readers out there.  A lot of that is due to the LCD touchscreen, but it's worth the hit to the battery life.  That being said, I have had no complaints with the battery life for my day-to-day usage and if you are a heavy user, you can buy a back-up/secondary battery to swap out (try that with your iPad!).  As the title says, I love my Nook, and it seems like Barnes & Noble has gotten the bugs fixed.  You can also take your Nook into Barnes & Noble and they'll go over all of the features and show you how to get the most out of it - not to mention you can read any e-book they have for free while in the store, and they are currently in a 5 week promotion where they are giving away 1 e-book each week to anyone who brings their Nook into the store.",Love My Nook!,1
172,2501,"Bought a Nook Simple Touch to use while traveling. After about 60 days, it locked up in sleep mode, and wouldn't respond to the Quick Nav Button nor the On / Off Button. Customer Service says its because I left it on the charger for more than 4 hours.So now I'm out about $100 (+ the cost of the books I downloaded) for an E-reader that doesn't work.

2461,2505,"Most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion, and most of it is accurate. The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be \upgraded\ to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.",A HALF COOKED NOOK,"1,3,4"
1372,2506,"Drove to a Barnes and Noble today.  The closest one to my house is 1 1/2 hours away.  I purchased my Nook.  I took it home, charged it for the 4 hours the store clerk suggested.  The problem came when I tried to register it so I can load up some ebooks.  I kept getting the error message that it can't connect, try again or call customer service.  After 5 attempts, I called customer service.  They were not surprised I couldn't register.  It seems that although the Nook is available for purchase in the stores, you can't register them due to serial number issues in their software.  Tech support doesn't feel this is information they need to pass onto the stores, so the stores have no idea.  So you have two choices, you can sit tight and wait for the problem to be rectified (btw - they have no idea when that will be), or you can return the item to the store and order a new from [...], becuase those units can be registered no problem.  For some people this may be no problem, but I don't know when I will have the 3 hours and extra tank of gas to go to the store to return it.  Oh, but all is not lost, Barnes and Noble did say they were sorry.",You can have it but you can't use it!!!,3

Pros - 1) super easy to use,  2) free book offers every week,  3) 3G wireless....instant gratification  Cons - 1) slow startup when you power it on, 2) Sometimes slow to react when turning the pages or using the touch screen  Even with the few cons, I still love it and would highly recommend the Nook.",My new addiction,"1,3,4"
1373,2525,"I have had my nook for almost two weeks now and I am very happy with it. I have not had any problem with it except that it froze twice. I didn't mind because all I had to do was turn it off and on. In December, I was thinking twice about getting the Nook because I read many bad reviews. I'm happy that I stuck with it because it is very responsive. It does not take long to go from one page to the next, it takes about the same time as turning a page on a paperback. The only thing that isn't so great is the battery... I'm a heavy reader so I have to charge my battery every two to three days(if i'm lucky). I wish that my battery did last 10 days as it is advertised. Overall, the Nook is very easy to use (read the manual first!)and it does its job well.",Love it!,"1,3"
2463,2527,"Ordered this because I had a Kindle that didn't have 3G. I like the method of reviewing items to order on Barnes & Noble and I like the reading surface of the Nook better than the Kindle.

1374,2529,"This is a review of the nook wifi. It is best purchased from an authorized dealer (Barnes & Noble or Best Buy). My nook cost $150 from BB and the nook wifi-3g costs $200. Why pay more at an unauthorized dealer?Beware, many of the reviews here are out of date. Amazon has come out with the Kindle 3 and there has been another software update on the nook (1.5) so many of the issues here have long been resolved. I have had my nook for one month and read 4 books and listened to one book. So far no problems at all.The Kindle 3 has the latest e-ink screen technology (pearl) but then the nook's 1.5 software update increased contrast between letter and screen.  When I put a book next to my nook, the nook's screen is whiter and the contrast between text and page greater so the nook's screen is good enough for me. Very easy on the eyes to read but you need the proper reading light.Not that it matters. My decision to choose the nook was based on its ability to read library books something the Kindle cannot do. The experience of going online to my public library is akin to going online to a bookstore. A few minutes download time and it's on the nook (first your computer then you sideload it from there to your nook). They return themselves to the library afterward too. I love romance books but hate paying $8-9 to read it once only to never read it again. Even the e-book romance price of $6 is hard for some of us on a budget.Other benefits of the nook:The nook is cool. Yes, the Kindle was redesigned and is now about the same size as the nook but the nook still looks waaay more elegant.The nook has a smaller color touchscreen for navigation that also shows the covers of your books in color.I can buy books from stores other than Barnes and Noble.I can replace the battery myself.I can expand the memory if I want (nice if you like to listen to music while you read or use the nook to listen to podcasts or audio books).",Elegant Reader,1

175,2534,I thought you should know why I chose the Nook over Kindle.  It wasn't the music addition or the photo addition options to the unit.  I love to read and have belonged to Doubleday Large Print book club for years.  The price of the books range from 20.95 to 19.95 most of the time. I can buy two to three books and at times have change left over.  As one of the Boomers I was looking for a way to keep my hobby of reading lots of titles on a retirement income.  The Nook was the perfect answer.  The Nook offered three advantages over the Kindle.  1.  I don't have to send it in to replace the battery.  May seem like this is not a big deal to some but like most personal hand held or computers its personal.  2.  The share books feature.  I have a sister who has MS and a really limited income to be able to share books with her is a blessing. 3.  I can expand the memory a very big deal.Its simple to operate and I can read more books for less money.,Why I bought the Nook,1

177,2555,"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.

Page turns are quicker and battery life is optimized a little bit more.I love having the option to insert a 16 gig Micro SD card and also use my Wifi connection at home to get updates and purchase books.  It's so much more reliable than using AT&T;'s spotty 3G network, although it is a little bit more of a power drain.One thing that hasn't really worked for me is the touch-screen 'swipe' that is supposed to simulate turning a page, but the buttons work just fine on the side and it's much more comfortable to let my thumbs rest there than have to put my finger down every time I want to turn a page.I'm not disparaging the Kindle though.  Just letting people know that with the new software update, the Nook is a much more improved device and ready to offer an attractive alternative.I have to agree with another poster.

188,2670,I had a Nook Tablet which was fine. Saw these at Barnes and Noble and picked some up for the kids. The difference between the HD and the table is night and day. The screen is amazing. The addition of Google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet. It also turns it into a Kindle. The kids are busy on all our long car rides. The SD card make it completely expandable. We can watch Netflix with Wi=fi or load the SD card with movies for a road trip. It's under 100 bucks too. GREAT!,Fantastic Value,1
1378,2678,"I recently bought the nook HD white for 129 greenbacks from BN. I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The Nook is lighter and the screen is brighter/sharper than the Kindle Fire. With the recent update to allow the full version of Google Play, a lot of the original limitations with the Nook have gone away. The chrome browser beats Silk all the way. You can actually download the Kindle App from the Google appstore and read all the books. However, you cannot install the amazon appstore and I had to buy some of the apps from Google play that I had originally purchased. There are no ads with the nook. Even with the Fathers day sale (which put the Kindle no-ad version at 195), this is cheaper by 65 bucks. An additional benefit is you can add an external SD card and there are options to boot a full blown standard Android Jellybean from the SD card with the nook from places like (AFN - android for nook for just 10 bucks).The two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera, but I really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the Kindle (you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered, but I have not fully figured it out).I liked it so much that I bought a second nook in smoke color today.",Best performance and unbeatable value in 7inch tablet,1

2473,2687,"I love mine. But there are glitches that come up. I had to replace my first one with a no hassle easy and quick replacement. I did have to send mine back first. But It would no turn on anyway so I couldn't use it. The replacement has lasted longer. But sometimes the WiFi turns on by itself. Sometimes it's just flighty about picking up signal no matter where I am, this happens in phases, especially after I have had to erase and deregister it. I have had to do that six times with this one, in order to get things to work properly. The Bluetooth drains the battery even though it is off. (I own a off brand Bluetooth keyboard, which may have began that problem). These problems drain the battery quite quickly so I my batter doesn't last. And my chargers are quite new. I called to have this second one replaced but there was a display issue with the third one and the headphone jack didn't work so I sent that back. I have stuck with my second one. I know this sounds like a mouth full of problems. But I am always satisfied with the customer service. I know that if I have any serious lasting problems, they will replace it, and also the new year of warranty starts over as soon as I receive the replacement, not dating back to my first one, which I have had since Mother's day 2013.Good things are, the google play enhancement, I use mine so often and it is an excellent tablet for $129.

2474,2688,"I've been using the Nook HD (7\) 8GB tablet for a couple of weeks now and I have some observations to share:1. If you think you are getting the same type of speedy 7\ tablet as a Nexus 7 (especially the 2013 refresh), you are going to be disappointed.  First off, it's an older model.  Second, it's got different internal components, which is why you can get it for under $120. Lastly, the Nook launcher/overlay is just more of an obstacle than a help.2. It's still a great value, IF you are planning on using it for reading, watching Netflix or Hulu, or for CONSUMING media.  It's not a creation-based device, but so few people create content, I think the market is still there for this device.3. Throw in a 16 or 32 GB microSD card and enjoy a LOT more room for your own media than what Nexus or Apple will give you in one of there devices. I went with the 8GB device and now have almost 40 with the expandable memory.4. It's a comfortable device to use, especially if you are already on the Google ecosystem. The only app I really miss having is MLB At Bat, but if you were to root and install an alternate operating system, it might work.  I can't speak to that. I can, however, tell you Google Books, Google Music, and virtually everything else I use for apps works on this device.So, is it worth $120? Yes. Is it the fastest, shiniest, coolest Android tablet on the market? No. That one is going to cost you more than $120. Spend the money, slap some extra memory on this thing, and you really can't go wrong.",Good value IF you have reasonable expectations,"1,3,4"

2479,2733,"For the price, $149.99 which I paid for my 16GB Nook HD+, this device is hard to beat.  The display sports a very good picture--one of the best I have seen--and the OS is pretty smooth with only some occasional lag, which might be an issue with certain apps.  When I opened my Nook and fired it up, Google Play had not been installed.  After a quick software update, Play appeared which allows me to download a great deal of Android apps onto this device.  I have since added all the apps which I consider to be essential, for me, and all of them work nicely.  As for the feel/design, it's nice.  The tablet isn't too heavy or too light, and all the buttons are placed nicely for ease of access.  Even better, this unit has a micro SD slot to expand memory.  The only thing missing from the last tablet I had, that I can tell, is the camera--and honestly, I don't care about that.  Cameras typically aren't that great on tablets anyway.My only issue with this tablet is the feel of the screen.  While it has one of the best pictures of any tablet I have seen, the way the screen feels when you slide your finger across it is, well, just not a smooth feel.  The screen picks up fingerprints very easily as well.  As of now, I have a Nook matte screen protector on mine, which makes it feel more like a GPS screen, but I imagine once I add a high quality glossy protector, this issue will be resolved.Bottom line:  if you're looking for an affordable tablet for reading and downloading Android apps, give this one a try.

However, after 2 weeks of daily (nightly) use, the light would no longer work if the arm was extended.  The light turns on when the arm is just barely unfolded, then it shuts off.  I replaced batteries several times thinking that was it, I tightened screws and nothing worked.  Barnes and Noble was less than helpful (they cited their return policy in SIX separate emails, in all of which I asked where I could get it repaired, not replaced) and told me that since the cover was used, and not made by Barnes and Noble, they couldn't help me.

It also has two bands at the top to hold it in place as well.  The black, rigid bottom has opening for whatever access you need from there, such as the charger.As for how well it protects, it will at as a buffer for the everyday dust, scratches, and fingerprints that will strike your Nook.

Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in \backwards\.  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.

I then read the back of the box and realized the error of MGM's ways. Had I took the time to read this in the store I doubt I would have bought it, though in hindsight who knows when another issue will be made, I'll likely ditch this and get that when it does. The best part about this release (and most important) is the sound anyway, and WOW they squeeze a lot of mileage out of Stereo Surround! I then rechecked the box to see if this was 5.1 and it wasn't but man oh man you'd never guess it twasn't! The picture is grainy on certain shots, others it is clear and bright, and it bothers me there ain't a whisker of an extra, but I guess that's for the \special edition\. 2/5On with the show!I really like this movie and always have. Being brought up on it I guess it's almost forced, almost like a religion, but watching this as an adult you certainly appreciate different things about the movie. I see Aunt Polly is VITAL to this movie, her lone performance raises this to another level. Celeste Holm was superbly cast! Johnny Whitaker in my mind IS Tom Sawyer however during casting I am surprised more thought wasn't put into casting a Tom that could, umm, you know, sing a note:) Jeff East as Huck has always been solid and Warren Oates as Muff Potter still shines. Watching this as full-grow'd man I do have regrets that more footage wasn't shot between the glorious Jody Foster's Becky and Johnny's Tom. That chemistry is almost scary considering it's comin' from young'ns. And who could forget the PC incorrect staggerin', \Injun Joe?!\ He haunted us all but now we just sit back and laugh... gulp, I didn't mean to say that JOE!! No, he's still got that terror filled look. 4/5While the songs can be a tad abrupt sometimes sprouting from dialogue they are generally fun and the melodies are almost always memorable. The theme song alone has been with me for many years. Overall, money comes and goes and while I would have liked to put mine towards a better edition, I doubt I could have put it towards a better Tom Sawyer, and yeah know, at this place in time that's all that really counts.",It's the most won-der-ful time... in your life!,"1,4"

When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the \DVD\ format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.

My purpose in writing this review is to warn parents purchasing this product for their child or teenager's cell phone that there is very adult material contained on the CD.There are three compressed files of photographs that, when extracted, create general folders then subfolders specifically labeled and containing various types of photos.

I have only one complaint: the notebook sits on the left side of the open cover, the Kindle on the right. Being right-handed, when I want to write something I end up with my right arm/elbow obscuring/touching the Kindle. Flipping the cover around means the notebook is upside down....One simple solution to making the package ambidextrous would be to create another opening to the flap where the notebook back cover can be inserted - by having a flap both top and bottom on that side of the cover both left- and right-handed users could make notes more easily. Apart from that, a fine product.",Could be better,"1,3,4"
1443,3600,I really like the cover and think it is a great add-on to the DX for people that still take hand written notes while reading. I already took a smaller moleskine with me whenever I read because I like to make drawings and notes while reading tech books. This cover gives me both in one piece. The outside feels just like a notebook and the inside is very soft. Plus a bonus was that I am left handed!! So this is natural for me to use. Some many times I end of making a right handed case or device just work. I highly recommend the cover.,Great cover for ones that still want to take written notes,"1,4"
2561,3602,"The Moleskin cover is the best traditional design that I have found to protect the Kindle DX.Protection:1) Oversized for extra of protection.- If a Kindle drops on its edge while in a case that exactly matches its external dimensions then the edge and corner of the Kindle will suffer virtually as much impact as if it were not in any cover at all.If however the case is oversized, as the Moleskin is, then the case will absorb most or all of the impact. I have had this experience which bore out the efficacy of choosing this case.2) Extra strength from the pad of paper.- Despite all of the turmoil about the tablet of paper it is a great way to provide extra protection for the screen, and the Kindle in general.Quibbles:1) The left hand placement of the pad of paperThis orientation is actually logical in order to maintain the access to the control buttons on the right side of the Kindle DX. If the pad had been placed on the right then you would lose the ready access to those buttons.2) Volume control barThe problem with the volume control bar being under the upper right elastic strap is real, but easily fixed. Simply cut a piece of a large paperclip, file the ends, and slide it under the elastic strap. (See a picture in customer provided images) It is a minor adaptation for a fine case.3) Pen holderIf the pad of paper is slid all the way to either side of its slot then a pen with a clip can be held in place with the clip in the slot and the pen barrel next to the pad of paper.",Best Protection in a Traditional Cover,"1,3"
256,3603,"Updated: It's been a little over a month since I've had my moleskine and while I still love the case, the novelty has worn off.The outer elastic band has become stretched out to the point where it dangles a ways away from the case. It's a cosmetic issue and I'm pretty anal about the way this case looks.The straps holding the iPad have also lost some elasticity but still hold in the iPad securely with normal, daily use. I've had the case in my backpack and thrown my bag on the floor after a long stressful day, causing the iPad to slip out of one strap. However, it was an easy fix.The spine did make a crackling noise, but mine is broken in to the point where it doesn't make the noise anymore. The downside with that was when i had the case folded in (outer covers touching), a nice angle was made, perfect for typing on a desk. That angle is gone now.I haven't cut a slit to make it possible for me writing with my right hand and might not. With the spine broken in, it's easy to fold the case into a size that's not too much larger than the original ipad's dimensions. I can easily have the iPad in the case on the left side of my desk and a spiral bound notebook on my left with enough space to comfortably write.With the elastic not as strong as it once was, I rated the case lower, but I still love it. But I still wish they would come out with an official moleskine case for the iPad.For the last 2 months, I've been searching for a case for my iPad that doesn't make my new purchase look tacky.  I bought the Incase Book Jacket and didn't like the inside leather trim and returned it the next day. I couldn't wait for Moleskine to release an official iPad cover, so I bought the Moleskine Kindle DX Cover thinking that the iPad would fit due to similar dimensions. While the straps are a tight fit, the iPad does fit inside beautifully and doesn't seem like it will be slipping out anytime soon. The top right strap does cover the power button, but its easy to push down on the elastic strap to get to the button for wake/sleep/power. The volume rocker and orientation lock are in no way covered by the strap as well, allowing for easy access. Apple headphones easily fit behind the top left strap, but headphones with an \L\ shaped plug would probably fit behind the strap more nicely. The bottom left strap covers just one of the 3 speakers but it in no way hinders the sound quality.The only complaint I have is that every time I open the cover, the pages of the paper notebook fan out, but its a problem that can easily be solved with a rubber band.I'm right-handed and the paper does get in the way, but I may cut a small slit on the opposite side of the notebook holder to be able to turn the case around and make it more comfortable for me to use.Could you DIY a moleskine case for the iPad? Sure. Could you wait for an official Moleskine cover for the iPad? Sure. But this definitely gets the job done now and looks beautiful inside and out.","For those wondering, it does fit the Apple iPad",1
2562,3612,"Pros: Excellent quality, notepad for taking notes, price (vs Amazon covers)Cons: No pen holder, no Kindle side-clips, costly notepad refills, left-handedAnyone who has ever used a Moleskine product will testify to their impeccable quality and this Kindle DX cover is no exception - great quality material and stitching, plush suede lining, signature notepad paper.Where this case lacks, however, is functionality - it does not utilize the Kindle patent-pending side-clips, opting instead for sturdy yet bulky rubber-band corners, one of which almost completely conceals the volume control buttons on the top right of the device. Another, in my opinion, tremendous shortcoming is the fact that this cover seems to be designed exclusively for the left-handed use. The notepad holder is non-reversible, forcing it to be on the left side of your Kindle, so you end up hitting it with your elbow while writing. For some reason Moleskine decided that your Kindle in this case will be a side-accessory to their tiny notepad.This case comes with two notepads, however they are only a few dozen pages thick, so you run out pretty fast and eachrefill notepadwill set you back about $10 with shipping.

1444,3629,"I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1\ mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.","It's an ok case, with some major flaws.","1,4"
2565,3630,"I have read many reviews on folio cases for iPad. You will find \the best ever\ in most of reviews that have got over four stars. So, I won't say the cliche, but want to say that I am very satisfied. Although I love my iPad, I'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful. Then, I bumped into this case. What a wonderful idea to put Moleskine with iPad!Someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick, and it is true. I feel like I am holding a book. However, it makes me feel that my iPad is well protected. The quality of paper is good as always, and it is very easy to flip over. Also, it also has the rubber band! Since I don't have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not, but the skin feels smooth and soft.",The best for those iPad lovers who eager to write something,1
2566,3633,bought because of Moleskine reputation ...big mistake... the ipad frame is too thick and  prvents gitting the homebutton quickly... thin straps for ipad and a place to store pen or stylus... paper pad replacement info?booo!,constricts use of ipad ...TOO thick!,"2,3"
2567,3634,"I was one of the first people to preorder the case and I received it from Amazon.com today.The Good1. Exceptional build quality2. Snug fit for the iPad3. Functionally great, with the note book attached.4. Looks great once fully covered and with the proverbial strap attached.The Bad1. With the iPad fit in, accessing the notebook seems a little less thought through. While the functionality for left handers is certainly in there, handling the whole thing is very cumbersome.The Ugly1. It's thick folks. It's really thick. With the notebook and the iPad and the padding, it is almost 1\ thick. If you use other cases, like the Dodocase, you wouldn't mind the thickness, but usingApple iPad Case (CASE-ZML MC361ZM/A), the increase in form profile is extremely discomforting.Verdict:1. If you love the dodo case and miss having a notebook combo, you will LOVE the Folio Digital Tablet cover.2. If you prefer the thin profile of the iPad, buy a Volant notebook and a skin for the iPad. This is not for you.","Amazing case, but not for me.","1,3,4"

1448,3672,"Overall the case is decent. It doesn't feel cheap, but it certainly doesn't feel as nice as you'd expect for this price.More disappointing though was the flawed design. The case says it's meant for both right handed and left handed writers, however, fails to mention that it's default is for left handed (notepad on the left, iPad on the right). When you switch the notepad around so it's on the right, the iPad Mini faces down (ie. the wrong direction). It doesn't seem so bad except the camera is then pointed in the wrong direction and the cover as well. Thus you either hold it backwards or open and flip it upside down to be on the proper side.These seems like a trivial problem, but when you're paying for a brand that charges for their design aesthetics, it's a bit disappointing. I mean, what percentage of the population writes predominantly with their left hand? I have no issue with it working for both sides but why not have the default option be created for the 80% of the population or make an option that switches back and forth more eloquently. Instead of having your case and iPad face the wrong way for the majority of your customers.Also the paper inside is not lined for those who might be interested to know.","Decent idea, flawed implementation.

I replaced a Samsung 30&#34; monitor that recently died and it is every bit as good a picture as the Samsung.  The only downside I can see is the monitor doesn't have any adjustments other than brightness/volume, but there is usually not any need for the other adjustments anyway.  The stand swivels but has no up/down adjustment. I don't see a single bad pixel on my monitor.

If you have a standard \on board/integrated\ graphics card, then this monitor might not work for you.... you may not have a DVI-D port and it may not be able to support this hulk.

I have no complaints about the display.The monitor does run HOT though, which I think is typical for this style.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW, unedited:It came with no English manual, and no DVDs for drivers.Windows is running mine with the generic driver. The best resolution I can get is 1280X800, which looks horrific.I'm aware that the problem *might* be my graphics card, but this card is definitely capable of handling at least 1080p, and I cannot get even that. I actually can set it to 1080p, but I immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberish.Can't get a setting for anything higher than 1080p, and definitely cannot actually use 1080p.I'm open to suggestions on how to fix this, especially if the seller is reading this.

It arrived in a reasonable amount of time, although the USPS mailing package had a huge hole ripped though it (postal workers are hard on packages). Fortunately the product was contained in a sturdy box & wrapped so there was no damage. The problem came when I attempted to hook everything up. I assumed it would just start playing, & for the cd I tested it did. When I put in a dvd it did not play. I got an error message after install that there was a \compatibility problem\. It directed me to search the 'net for troubleshooting or change my screen resolution. I did both & got nowhere. After tinkering with it for 30 minutes I was about to call it quits & return it. I remember reading a few comments that said you had to install VLC MEDIA PLAYER before it would work. I found the free download & voila! It worked.

I shouldn't expect much, but in reading some of the other reviews it sounds as if others received a higher quality unit & had a choice of colors.

268,3920,"I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.

My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.

You put a 3.7 volt battery in it, you get a \one strobe light\ and its all over. These batteries perform as stated, the voltage must drop as power is applied because my light is still going strong. Several charges, they seem to last fairly well. Some have said they dont last as long as regular CR123`s you throw away, and in this light, I will agree. However, with disposeable batteries, they work until the very end getting dimmer and dimmer to a light factor I cant use anyway. These batteries lose some power to the point of \I know its not as bright as it should be\ then shut off completely. Thats fine for me, I want it to stay bright when its turned on and I am using it, thats why I bought a 180 lumen light.

287,4084,I just got my mini mic and my Chill Pill Rapcap in the mail today.I bought both for my iPod Class 120gig for recording lectures. I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.,Identical to RapCap,1

My new case is a hard snap-on one that has an edge that comes right to the edge of the headphone jack. This prevented me from making a connection because the case kept the mic from being fully inserted. I discovered that this problem was easily solved, however, by grinding away some of the plastic on the mic so that it doesn't hit the case as badly.

I was going back and forth between this one and a real leather red one and when I read a review on the red one about their iPad slipping out of the top and falling that's what made me go with this one. It slides in from the inside so it's secure all the way around. The magnetic clasp makes it easy to open.  Good to have the screen protector. It's very slim and not bulky. It props up. And it's got a faux fur imprint on it too.  Very chic! If I had one complaint it would be that it had a very strong plastic smell when I unwrapped it, but it's fading and I'm assuming it will go away after it's aired out for a few days.Edited: the cover started coming apart about 6 months after purchase. The vinyl covering over the clasp is cracked and has peeled off in several places. The lining around the edges of the inside that holds the iPad has also almost completely come loose and had to be removed. Also had to buy a silicone sleeve to keep the iPad from sliding out of the cover.  The cover itself that is visible on the outside still looks the same except that it is worn off on the edges.

I doubt that this product is really sold by Sony here.[Old, Original Review]This cable arrived much earlier than what was said which came as a surprise. The length of this cable is longer than the original one I got with my Xperia ION. To give the readers a fair idea: it is as long as Sony or Philips earphones. The diameter of the cable is about 4mm. From the two pictures provided here on Amazon, I thought it was going to be thicker. I would like to think it is thick enough to not get tangled up.

So far I have been looking for a GB MicroSD card for my phone. After hearing lots of reviews but also problems from the other SanDisk 32GB how it caused some problems for others who had the Galaxy s4 and it erased memory/data, but worked for a lot. I didn't want to take the risk of losing data or pictures/music on my phone by getting the 32 GB. Maybe the 32GB didn't work for some because they already had data and pics on it already or the GB was too big to handle.After hearing a lot of good reviews from the Professional Ultra SanDisk 16GB also, I prayed that this memory chip work for my phone. Sure it wasn't a 32GB, but it was big enough to hold more pictures and apps on it.

1535,4834,"I read the manufacturer's Product Description and found it lacking or totally void regarding the construction, materials and make-up of the product. I see a list of claims of what it may do, claims made by the seller, but no information about the product that would in-turn support such claims. What kind of copper cut how many times? Silver is the best signal conductor so how much, if any, silver is in the cable and how is it cut and combined with copper strands to facilitate the signal? What sort of housing is used to prevent outside interference, EM and other, from affecting the signal and to prevent the signal inside from degrading? I like to save money but not at the expense of decreased performance thus value from my video and audio equipment. I find these listings insulting and wonder if Pioneer Elite would recommend that I purchase this cable with their $2200 BDP-09FD Elite Blu-ray player to help ensure maximum benefit from their product. When I searched Amazon for the new Blu-ray these cables came up. The average Amazon shopper needs to be advised that there is no connection (no pun intended) between the product, BDP-09FD, and the cables which appear when searching for this product other than that created by the cable seller. I can easily see considerable difference between this cable group and higher-end product such as Audioquest or Monster making it worth spending 20 or 30 times more money , although they too have cheaper made product within their offerings to accommodate specific applications and budgets. Please note that the application is important so being the most expensive does not equate to being the best just like being the least expensive does not make it good enough. I heard an honest statement some time ago \No cable can improve a signal. The right cable can insure the signal that arrives at its' destination is the same as it was when it left its' source.\ Another valid quote \Your system can be no better than its weakest link.\ Today's high band width high-definition video and audio devices make the right investment in cables and power management devices more crucial than ever before. The salesperson that tells you a cable is the correct cable because it has gold plated ends IS trying to add something to the sale as ALL decent cables have gold plated ends because gold is malleable and makes a great snug connection. Gold has nothing to do with carrying or protecting the signal. If the salesperson talks about the questions raised above, they may be looking after your equipment investment. Tell that to the salesperson and see what they say and let me know.",What's Under The Hood?,4

Isn't that a mouthful for a product description?  I'd have thought Canon HTC-100 would be enough.  I'm compelled to say this because if you search Amazon for \Canon HTC-100\ you'll find 1.5-, 2-, 3-, even 4-meter cables, supporting HDMI 1.3, 1.4, you name it -- often from the same manufacturer.  There's even a genuine Canon HTC-100 for sale -- except half the reviewers warn they didn't receive a genuine Canon cable.  Amazon needs to take some responsibility for creating major confusion over generic replacement products like this sold by a third party and fulfilled by Amazon.  And Canon shares some blame too since Canon Direct doesn't list any specification for an HTC-100 -- for all I know they get them from Amazon.Here's what I know:  I paid $8.25 for my HDMI cable.  It came in a labelled, OEM-style plastic bag with a UPC code of 9983891204.  It works perfectly, connecting my Canon 7D camera to my Samsung HDTV.  The connectors are gold-plated.  The cable itself is of reasonable quality and will probably outlive my camera and my TV.  There are reusable protective plastic caps on the connectors (you are responsible for not losing them).  Given that Canon Direct wanted more than 8 times the price I paid for their version of this cable (after a 15% discount at that), I'm rather pleased with my purchase. I am not so pleased with the confusion that Amazon and Canon have created here -- consumer brand loyalty is a real thing; manufacturers and retailers mess with it at their peril.",A fine product but a poor buying experience,"2,3"

My big problem with this particular cable is that it's so damn short.  It's between two and three feet long and, while I should've been more thorough before purchasing it, I honestly can't see a description anywhere on this page that tells me how long it is.  If you need to use it at all while it's charging, then you really want a longer cord (five or six feet would probably be perfect).  I'd have to be sitting directly in front of an outlet in a really low chair in order to use this while charging.  Granted, just keeping it charged will prevent this from being an issue, but if you're capable of doing that 100% of the time, you're a better person than I am.That said, if none of that matters to you, my experience is that it (along with the adapter the Touchpad came with) charges my Touchpad perfectly, despite some of the other reviews I've seen here saying it doesn't.

These are quiet tapes and don't produce any noise.I don't know what else to say about these. If you just happen to need a cassette, these are a great option.",Saved Me!,1
1619,5952,It has been a while since i have used audio tapes and i was surprised that my recording came out so well.,winner,1
1620,5954,"The hay-day of cassette manufacturing was the early 1980's, when all the audio cassette companies had made their products in Japan.  In particular Maxell was leading the edge with their epitaxial formula tape.  This tape was inserted into their \UD\ \XL-I\ \XL-II\ and \XL-II-S\ cassette models.By 1982, Maxell's audio cassettes had four major advances, which would see the audio cassette technology at its absolute perfection.1.  PX Pure Crystal Gamma2.  Unique Binder (prevented shedding oxide)3.  Dimpled Slip Sheets4.  Square Hubs1.  Maxell was the leader of the pack, as their unique PX Pure Crystal Gamma particle oxide formulation would give a clean stable sound output.2.  An extremely advance binder would keep recorder heads clean, even when several hundred of these tapes were played on a tape deck.3.  Also contributing to the cassettes flawless operation was the concept that the tape spools where sandwiched between to highly dimpled slip-sheets.  This gave the tape an ultra smooth travel whether in playing or winding mode, as the force from the dimpling would continuously align the tape into neatly wounded spools.  This was possible, as the dimpling would subject the tape to a tight force on both sides.  The concept would ultimately give 100% perfect tape to head alignment as the tape would always pass by the head in exactly the same spot to where it was recorded.A small draw back of the tape dimpling was that it might have made the tape travel a little tight.  This would seldom cause the tape to jam, and was really no more or less of a problem, comparative to other brands.4.  The central area of the cassette had square shaped hubs, which would greatly reduce wow and flutter, as the rollers would grip the tape hubs with more precision.1978 to 1987 was Maxell at its finest hour.The rot started to set in when the late 80's, early 90's trend, \cost cutting\ started to set in like a cancer.The first thing to go was the backbone to Maxell's flawless cassette operation, the legendary square hubbed cassette shell.  This took place about 1988-1989.  Instead, new shells were created with an oval window, and the square shaped hubs were replaced with the stock standard rounded hubs.About the same time, the tightly dimpled cassette slip-sheets that had sandwich the tape spool, was replaced with a flatter, lesser-dimpled slip-sheet.  This became obvious, as the tape spool made much less contact to the sheet, when in play and winding modes.I would assume Maxell did this in reaction of consumers complaining about the noise tapes made when winding, and the jamming caused through the tightness of the sheets.  I pretty much look at this change, comparative to consumers complaining about a car engine making too much noise, so the manufacture decides to take the engine out.  Can you see the absurdity here?  If a tapes performance was perfect during recording and playing modes, who would care less about the noise a tape makes when in a winding mode?The next thing to change was the binder, which would have taken place about 1994-1995.  Tapes I used during this period of time notably left more oxide shedding on my heads.  To save on manufacturing costs further, Maxell would have used a cheaper binding substance, which in turn wouldn't have binded the oxide to the tape as tightly, comparative to it's original binder used in the early 80's.At this point, the cassettes audio output, notably in the 12,000 to 20,000 htz range was starting to become inferior to the early 80's models.  Changes in the manufacturing of the slip-sheets, and cheaper binder would have created notable azimuth issues.  The slight misalignment would cause the high-end frequencies to dull out.During 1996 to 1997, Maxell still manufactured reasonable quality UE, UR, XL II, and XL II S cassette models.  Unfortunately their UD, UDI, and UDII were starting to lag terribly in quality, and the LN tapes were also in the range of questionable.  Many of these tapes would become discontinued by 1999, as CD-R became more popular, but the UR tape was still a fair all round tape.By 2001, Maxell had discontinued most of their tape lines, leaving the XLII and UR model as their only choices for analog buffs like me who still like the ease of using cassette tapes.2002 saw the last nail hammered into the audio cassette coffin, when Maxell discontinued it's XL II tape, (no longer available in Australia), and the use of a much cheaper, (and nastier) polyester tape for their \UR\ model tape.  EBay seems to be swamped with these audio cassettes as nobody wants them, and they are constantly listed with no bids or buyers.Occasionally, the tapes that Maxell used to be known for back in the 80's can still be found on eBay, but at highly inflated \supply and demand\ prices.  A box of original \Maxell UD 90\ tapes from 1981 went on eBay last week for over US$200 with 17 bids.This is a situation that the Management of Maxell should take full advantage of.  They don't have to manufacture cassettes in the same quantity and variety as they did back in the early 80's, as the market is plainly not there.  However it would be fantastic if Maxell could still manufacture at least one or two good quality model tapes, exactly the way they were made during the 1985 period.  It would be awesome to see the original UD tapes and XLII tapes, exactly the way they were manufactured in 1985.Hopefully someone at Maxell will see this review, do a check on eBay, and realise how popular good quality blank cassette still are.The return of the original \Maxell UD\ tape, may come to a shop near you, fingers crossed!","Maxell, once a great brand, now just \made in china\ junk!",4

414,5960,"Like another reviewer on the 90-Minute 5 Pack item, I can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism. On my Nakamichi BX-300, they frequently stop during recording or playback. It's a tension problem, wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage; basically, it thinks the tape is stuck. Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. I've had no problem with other, commercially available cassettes on this deck.My advice, if you have these tapes, is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape, then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape, after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side, until I performed the above. YMMV.

They are cheap, very hard plastic and uncomfortable. You can slide them around, but unless your head matches the curve of the frame exactly, you will have difficulty finding a comfortable fit. The sound quality is tinny and mediocre. The cord and plug are made of the thinnest, cheapest, flimsiest materials, and will easily break. The plug is not L-shaped which means it is vulnerable to breaking at the point of connection.Additional warning: there are a couple of different listings for HP-200s on Amazon, and depending on the one you are looking at, the photos of the product might be deceptive in that you can't see how inflexible (and thick) the frames are, and in some cases, the photo doesn't match the product you wind up buying.Be particularly wary of the photo showing the \cans\ flipped around, suggesting a flexible swivel design.

I went to the nearest Walmart and bought these headphones because they cost only 5 dollars and I trusted the Maxell brand name.  I was really shocked how good they sounded.

1642,6260,"When it comes to headphones I'm anything but easy on them. A pair, with me, usually lasts a maximum of six months. If they last longer than that they are lucky. Therefore, I decided to go on a search today to find a pair of earbuds that sound at least average, are comfortable, and seem to put up with some rough activities. I do have my Sony MDRE828LP earbuds, but the cord is starting to come off and the right side of the earbud gets blown out every once in awhile which is a sign that they're on its last couple of weeks. And I didn't want to get stuck without any earbuds for my iPod.I bought these at...Walgreens. Yes, Walgreens. If I went all the way to Target or Wal-Mart my day would be gone. Walgreens doesn't typically have much more of a selection of headphones other than two brands, Maxell and Philips. Maxell had a pair of earbuds, but they were the deaded white. I looked at other selections and I found the HB350F headbuds. They seemed like a good deal and were on sale for seven dollars.Hey, what do you expect for the price? At least something that has fair bass, good mids, and a clear sound. These do indeed have a clear sound. However, they have a really bad lack of bass tones. They don't sound BAD, depending on your standards, but to me were not worth it at this price-point. Even with the bass booster on, no matter what I tried I just could not get a good sound out of these headphones. I thought that since these were canalphones that they would supply much more of a solid low-end.Unlike other earbuds, these are a bit different. As shown on the Amazon picture (although mine were red, not black) they have a band on the headphones, which makes these have a more secure fit so you won't have to worry about the earbuds falling off all the time while running or doing outdoor activities. But the comfort is killed by the design of the earbuds. The earpieces are huge and did not fit in my ears very well. After thirty minutes of wearing these my ears were in extreme pain.For other extras, they do have a volume control, but don't get too excited here. It's more like a loud to a mild sound than it is very loud to off, but it could be useful in some cases. Also they have a nice folding action that makes them fit perfectly into my iPod's case.I used to own the Maxell HB202 headbuds and was dissatisfied with the fit, and these are no different. They have a well designed folding action, and don't fall out of my ears, but are painful to wear and do not sound up to the price. If you find these at a very low price, like under five dollars, they may be worth it if you have big ear canals. Otherwise, not a good set to me at all. 2 stars.",Poor Sounding and Designed Headphones from Maxell Once Again,2

2815,6674,"Great radio in terms of portability. I use it at the beach, Red Sox games and Patriots games at the stadiums. It has a lot of great sound. Despite the 4 star review, there was one problem. After normal wear and tear use, the middle buttons ceased to work...Preset button 3, the weather button and the clock stopped working and it continued to flash 12:00 like a VCR. Because of the broken clock button, I couldn't reset the clock. When those buttons did work, it was great. However I still use the radio without those buttons and the radio flashes 12:00. I wish the clock would work, but oh well....The clock feature was great when you wanted to have a radio that gave you a clock and radio at the beach when you didn't want to take a watch with you. I wound up buying another copy of this radio when this one totally goes. There is also an issue with the blue plastic material where the buttons are. The blue flexible material will probably break eventually as the power button did, but the power button is still functional. Finally if you're considering a radio with TV sound, it's a good perk. However when TV signals go all digital in 2009, I am not sure if you'll still be able to get the TV sound. The TV sound works great if you're near where the TV stations broadcast. The weather band does me no good because I am in Boston and NOAA doesn't broadcast near the city. This is a great radio. If the buttons do break, it will be your only disappointment. I would never use it in the shower. I transmit Satellite Radio on FM transmitters and I use it to listen to XM and Sirius in my house and it does an awesome job. Considering the fact that it uses 3 C Batteries, it's worth it for the sound quality. The presets are convenient and the sleep timer also is a good perk to save your batteries if you listen at night before sleeping. Overall a great radio. If the buttons break, it's disappointing, but I got a decent amount of use from the radio before that happened. Shower radios are generally junk. This is a Sony and they always make good products.

I got about 7 years of EXCELLENT performance from these radios.  I have 2 because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed.  The other goes between kitchen and office constantly.  There's 5 presets for AM.  I wish there were more.  There's 10 presets for FM.  One used to be for Howard until he left (a huge Howard fan here who has not gone Sirius) and now I basically only use one for WCBS-FM (when they got smart and realized, in the immortal words of NY Daily News, that they didn't know jack), and the others go unused.  The TV channel part of this radio, I never use and couldn't comment.The radio is excellent.  The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.  After 7 years of pressing the on/off button I'm sure thousands of times, the plastic over the on/off button ate through.  The on/off button needs that plastic over it to work!!  The damn thing won't turn on/off now!!  I tried turning the volume down to zero to \turn it off\ but the batteries do wear out and it's annoying.So I figure that 7 years of constant usage is pretty good and I am not complaining and have even come back for more!In spite of the 7-year life, I still give this radio the highest rating.

1673,6810,"I bought the Sonys when the gym installed a new music system which blared out pop music--obviously the worst CDs in the customers' collection, to get rid of which they donated to the gym. For this purpose, they proved okay, not great, but at least good enough that I renewed my membership.Where they really shine is on an airplane. The drone of the jet engines is cut by half or two-thirds, and you don't know how tiring that sound is until you've switched it on and off with a pair of noise-canceling headphones. Much the same is true in a bus or automobile, and I never travel without them. The Sonys come with an adapter plug for the airliners' audio system, so there's never any question of buying or renting airline phones. Shucks, I've probably paid for the Sonys in that alone.Note that the phones work best on steady background noise, so they're great with turbojets but only fair with conversation. This has nothing to do with Sony and everything to do with acoustics. So the crying kid in the seat behind you is going to sound about the same whether you have the noise-canceling turned on or off. (He will be quieter simply because you have these earphones snug over your ears.)For severe situations, like the MTV music in the gym, I've seriously considered using wax earplugs and turning up the volume on the Sonys, but most of the time they suffice, and so I've never gotten around to it.An excellent investment in your hearing and in your sanity.",I don't leave home without them!,5
1674,6811,"I wore these for about an hour while riding the bus and couldn't wait to take them off. Maybe if I could find a way to replace the minimal amount of padding around the ears they would be better, but I doubt if I can.  The headband felt fine.They did reduce the background noise to some extent, but it was still noticeable on the bus.  Actually, my ipod headphones were louder than the Sonys with the ipod set at the same volume, but the sonys seem to be a little easier on my eardrums due to the fact that their not jammed in my ear canal.I'm considering returning these and getting the Bose QuietComfort 2. Although $300 for a pair of headphones is obscene, I need something good for long flights and I'm not sure that these will do the trick.These headphones suck without the noise reduction turned on.  With it on the sound is better, although somewhat muddy compared to the headphones that came with my ipod. I suppose I would rather wear these on a plane, bus, or train than my ipod headphones because they are easier on my eardrums, while still allowing me to hear the words of the music I'm listening to.As you can see they look great and they fold up nicely too.  I wish they would just make them more comfortable.",Uncomfortable But Works A Little....,4
468,6815,A few years ago I was travelling about 130k miles a year so I was constantly on airplanes.  I got a gift certificate as a present and used it to purchase these.  I'm glad I did not \pay\ for these.I was mostly into the ANR on flights.  Sound quality was important but having a turbine 96000 lbs of thrust 15 feet away kind of reduced this to \can I roughly hear what I'm trying to hear without blasting the volume\ as I knew removing all background noise was impossible.So how are they? They are ok but I'd rather have gotten a really good Passive NR set than these ANR headset.  I just don't think they justify the price.Pros:  1 - sufficient ANR for airplanes2 - roll up into a ballCons:  1 - brutally painful as the padding is about 3 millimeters thick2 - painful after an hour3 - lots of plastic construction so you really have to baby them4 - not able to find thicker replacement ear pads5 - painful after an hourI haven't tried the Bose standard headset.  I've used their $1000 aviation headset a few times and they were excellent for ATC but no idea how they are for music though (I didn't have an iPOD to plug into the Cirrus at the time).  I'm sure their standard headsets are excellent but also very pricey.Gerald,Painful,"1,3"
469,6816,"After having used this headphone for a little over a year it has become virtually unusable. The plastic parts started creaking very soon. What seemed to be tolerable in the beginning has become ridiculous now. It is triggered by the slightest movement of the head, the jaw or even by taking a deep breath and sounds like an old ski-boot right on your ear.The shells do not encompass the ears but rather sit on the outer rim of the earlobes. And no, I don't have extremely big ears. That's simply how this headset was designed. Watching an entire film on a plane leaves you with hurting ears. The noise reduction is very good but I'd rather go nuts from the engine noise than wear the Sony MDR-NC20 for the duration of a transatlantic flight.The sound quality with noise canceling switched off is feeble and thin. However with the noise canceling on very satisfactory.Update: Now the cable has come apart and one side of the headphones has gone mute. After careful usage for a little over one year the MDR-NC20 is officially broken. I really wanted to love this thing and I treated it with more careful respect than anyone who actually takes their headphones on the road all the time. I will check out the Bose noise cancelers next...","(two stars!) Mechanical creaking and pressure on ear lobes, not so cool.","2,3"

470,6818,"I travel a LOT. Fly on everything from TurboProps to Airbus A-320's and 757's. I've never been able to sleep on aircraft and lately, my tolerance for noise and screaming kids has gone to near zero. Well, that's what the Sony MDRNC-20 noise cancelling headphones have given me, ..... nearly zero noise on flights. My last two flights (this week) were on two SAAB TurboProp commuter aircraft and two A-320's and I could not hear the engines with these headphones on. I also use a Sony R70 MiniDisk Recorder / Player that was useless, due to in cabin noise, until I bought these headsets. I've tried the Bose (overpriced and cumbersome), Sennheiser and Toshiba units and the Sony's are the best. I highly recommend them for frequent fliers if you want to be able to function at the destination end of the flight. OH! Did I mention that we also use them while cutting grass on our diesel Kubota tractor with 60 inch mower deck and can't hear the tractor noise, but Bon Jovi comes through lound and clear from the Sony CD Walkman. The audio connection cord also has a convenient connector in it so your can disconnect the main lead and just use the headphones for noise reduction. I thought this a very convenient feature for those who want to block out TV noise, kids, neighbors, etc and not listen to music at the same time.It might sound like I'm a Sony fan (which I am) but I'm also an audio engineer and my motto is \Specs first, price second\. I was pleased to find a product that cost over $120 less than Bose and worked every bit as well, .... maybe better.You need a pair of these if you fly a lot or just want some peace and quiet.",Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones are GREAT!,1
471,6820,"I bought these headphones when i was Japan, and have been nothing but pleased. Some things to note:1)They're made of plastic- I expected something better.On the other hand, they fold up into a neat little ball,so they are more breakage resistant that you might expect.Also, the design is great since the noise cancelling equipment is contained within the headphones,not in a clunky external box like other, less styling models (^_^)v Very very sleek and sexy.2)Those of you planning to use these with an MD player/etc. w/ an inline remote should note that while the headphones have a \short cord\the plug is actually a stupidly useless *proprietary* sony design-and the included 1/8th adaptor cord is *very* long; that is to say,you'll end up w/ tons of excess wire you don't know what to do with.There is a short Sony minijack-to-1/8th adaptor which works great,however,I've never seen it sold outside of Japan.I am incredibly happy with these headphones.However,as others have mentioned the sound is so-so.These are perfect for use with MD/MP3 or other compressed sound formats in noisy settings, but not so great for precise listening.But turning on the noise cancelling greatly improves the sound quality and I find that these headphones are more than adequate for all of my needs-combine this with the fantastic design,the awesome noise cancelling ability,a great-bang-for-your-buck value (except for the plastic),and I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good noise cancelling headphone.","Fantastic Design, Great NC, but Sound is so-so",1

Following the manual's advice, I took out the battery, replaced it, and... it rewound/exposed the whole roll.  Since it was under warranty, we took it to the camera shop to have it repaired.  The owner told us he got this problem with Elphs a lot, and if we had this problem again, we'd be better off purchasing a new, different camera than paying to have it fixed.While it worked, I took the best photos of my life... crisp, clear, gorgeous!I used that camera without a problem until early this year when the &quot;H&quot; returned.  For a while I was able to reset it.  Then it started eating brand-new rolls of film.Part of me really wants to buy another one because it took such great pictures and was so fun to use.

Other family menbers have had a series of 35mm Point-and-shoots, but the 370Z is better.  Reliable (at least for me), simple to use, with a zoom range that goes from true wide-angle (most don't) to portrait-length telephoto (the regular ELPH doesn't).

I hated having to manually update my monthly planner whenever a  new year rolled in (things like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.). Another  reason was because I wanted all my contact information to be in one single  place.  I had these info spread out all around me like a wild fire (some at  home, at work, in the bathroom, ah... just kidding on the bathroom, but you  get the point, right?). With this Palm I can have upto 12,000 people in my  address book (I have 100 so far and I've been telling people that the  10,000th person to go into my palm address book gets free dinner from me,  ha.Now, then the reason I bought Palm IIIx over visor and other Palm  products was due to various reasons. I did a intense research to find out  which product would best fill my needs. Visor had the cool design going and  maybe cool features like modules that can be added to turn your visor into  mp3 players, etc. But from what I found out, these feature were not being  fully utilized just yet (maybe in one more year someone said).

I received my Palm IIIx as a gift about 7 months ago, and I have lost all of the data in my organizer 8 times.  I am an active  professional in the television industry and I travel to remote parts of the  world for weeks at a time.  I have been away from my computer (to HotSync  and restore the data) all but one time and have been left without vital  professional and personal contacts as well as lost all new contacts and  production memos and notes.  I have determined the cause of the failure.  If you own a Palm IIIx and have it with you, follow along with me.  Locate  the battery compartment on the back of the unit.  Open it up and look at  the way the compartment is designed to have the batteries installed.  The  top AAA battery slot is designed such that the positive end of the battery  (the one with the 'bump') must maintain contact with a wire coil.  What  happens is this.  Let's say you have your Palm IIIx in your purse,  briefcase, backpack, fannypack or WHEREVER.  If you drop your bag, set it  down a little too hard, or even RUN with it, chances are that the contact  coil will slip off of the positive terminal on the battery and you'll lose  all of the memory in your organizer.  First and foremost, I CANNOT BELIEVE  that 3Com allowed this product to be released with such an incredibly inept  design flaw.  Second, I can't believe that they didn't install a back-up  battery to which the organizer defaults in cases of lost power for ANY  reason (let alone because the inherent design of the product leaves it  prone to losing power and therefore data).  Finally, 3Com Customer Service  has done NOTHING to respond to my repeated attempts to bring this to their  attention and ameliorate the situation.

So the choice is a Palm Vx, a Palm V, a IIIx or a Visor. I can't recommend the Visor right now due to the horrible problems people are  having with Handspring...maybe in another year, but not now.The new Vx  is a good choice, lots of memory and the other advantages of the Palm V  like a better screen, and rechargeable battery. But the darn thing is still  overpriced. If money is no problem though, I'd probably go with the Vx.The V is good too, but only 2 meg of memory...yuck! Now, 2 meg of memory  is going to be enough for a lot of people. If all you want to do is the  basic appointment/phone book/to-do stuff, 2 meg is more than you'll ever  need. But that's it...you're stuck with 2 meg and can't upgrade (easily).  If you are interested in using your Palm to do internet stuff, grab  webpages with AvantGo, play games, read books, etc. you're going to find  yourself a bit squeezed by 2 meg. You can still do quite a bit, but it's a  bit more work to manage your space.Now, for less money you can get the  IIIx. You'll have twice as much memory, and the ability to upgrade. I  personally put on the TRG xtra xtra pro board which gave me 4 meg more of  RAM and 2 meg more Flash...it's like having an 11 meg Palm! Really great.  Of course, I bought this before the Palm Vx came out, today it's not quite  as good a deal to do.One other reason I like the Palm IIIx is that I  have a lot of add-ons that only work with it...the Palm Navigator  (compass), the Weatherguide, Landware's GoVox voice recorder, etc. I don't  believe these will fit a Palm V. Of course, it goes both ways....Palm's new  33.6 modem and the new wireless Omnisky modem only fit the Palm V.I do  believe the Palm V has a better screen, it doesn't seem to have the streaks  that a lot of the Palm IIIx's have.

Right now it's the lowest cost 3com  unit that has the upgradable OS capability, which I think is an important  feature.  If you have the $50, you might as well move up to the xe and get  the extra 4 mb of memory, but if you don't and need a workhorse, there  isn't much the more expensive IIIxe will do that the IIIx can do just as  well.

Second, the tuning circuit could do with an additional RF amplifier stage  to overcome the slightly snowy reception on all but the strongest channels.  The tuner is a little slow to start scanning when the set is switched on  or when changing from VHF to UHF and it easily passes over some stations  requiring you to back up the tuning bar to lock onto the channel.  Once  tuned in, the signal quality is consistent.  I hope in subsequent versions  of this set RCA decides to upgrade the tuning circuits and set the hue more  accurately or porvide a customer control for color.On the whole this is  a good product that should provide many years of dependable service if you  don't mind the temperamental tuner.

When it does this, you have to unplug the machine from the outlet for about a half hour.  Apparently this resets something and allows it to read again.

I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with \D\ batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a \DX Machine\ both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.Although not quite as good as its predecessor the SuperRadioII, it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of AM and FM without any bells or whistles to get in the way.If you can find it discounted, then pick one up and listen away.

I had hopes for this model (mine is branded GE, but it's the same as the RCA version), but it has been rather disappointing.  This is a good radio for listening to local news and other talk radio, and it puts out substantial if not refined sound for listening to music on FM, so it's particularly good for when I'm working outdoors or in the garage.  Unfortunately, it's not easy to tune distant AM stations precisely, and the unilluminated tuning display is difficult to read in dim light.  Battery life with this radio seems to be very good, one of the best features of this model.  It also seems to be fairly sturdy, having survived a 3 ft. fall to the floor.  When it comes to AM radio reception, there are probably a few better models on the market--at least I hope there are--but they will probably cost more.

At night, it can be several hundred miles.

I rolled the dice and ordered one any way. Shipping was quick. My nostalgia for the quaint bulky design and big-speaker sound was satisfied. FM reception was always just okay even on the older models, so no big surprises there...but the real problem, and it is a big one, is that regardless of signal stregnth you'll never quite feel that you've tuned the dial to exactly the right spot to properly hear your station of choice, especially on AM (but FM too). There's an annoying hiss and other noise indicative of a poorly tuned in station -- no matter which station you choose. Using the wide/ narrow band switch doesn't help.

497,7162,"My first Superadio III was purchased in late 1993 (...) The FM sensitivity was great as I could pick up weaker stations from Cookeville and Livingston, Tennesssee from my house in Murfreesboro (80 to 95 miles). The same could be said in the other direction Huntsville Alabama and Chattanooga. On AM, I received Louisville, KY and Memphis, Tennessee in the daytime (200+ miles) and Cincinnati, Chicago, Des Moines, Detroit, and New York City by night. Sound quality was VERY GOOD and tuning was generally accurate for an analog dial.Earlier in 2004, I bought a second one. (...)  No substantial changes from appearance or sound performance are noted.  However, tuning distant stations seems a bit more difficult with the newer radio.  Also, tuning contains more inaccuracies on AM.  Furthermore, plastic knobs seem more flimsy which means they must be treated with extra care to avoid breakage and premature wear.Both radios are manufactured in China, so it is possible they may have come from the same factory. My eleven year old GE Superadio III, in my judgment, has the better overall quality.Verdict: if a no-frills radio (e.g. no dial light, digital presets, or shortwave) is what you desire, look no further. It is the best value around and produces excellent sound. If one is particular about dial tuning and cabinet durability, examine carefully and buy from a store that has a good return policy as an exchange may be required to get a accurate tuning dial.  If a high end radio is what you desire and need, consider a CC Radio or a Bose Wave Radio (about $169 and $349, respectively) over the Superadio III.","A good overall value, but be careful which batch you get.","1,3"
498,7163,"I've been a \DX'er\ (distant signal listening nut) for forty years and I cannot say enough about the GE SUPER. At home I constantly listen to NPR talk radio and so have five of these suckers. Two for the bathrooms, one for the bedroom, one for the garage, and one for gardening/yardwork. At the price, what the hell!Bought my first one twenty years ago for truck camping in NE Canada. Since, have camped in the way-out reception areas of most of the USA and a fair piece of Canada. When it's just you and the  Poodle dog (and a couple of sixers), camping out at midnight on some godforsaken' 4-WD logging road in the mountains, it can feel spooky lonely and you want to hear another human's voice...this is the ticket.Why's it so got such amazing reception? It's sophisticated circuitry was developed back when there weren't nearly as many broadcasters as now, and consumer's (many being quite rural) wouldn't buy a piece of scheiss as they nowadays do.Why's it so cheap for it's performance? The expensive design of the electronics, albeit cheap form factor, long ago paid for themselves; now it's just stamp out the same old product without ever having to update your radio just for appearance's sake. This is the same reason why the second best portable radio, the Sony ICF 2010 AM/FM/LW/MW/SW, can be sold for such a low price (if theye're still being sold).What makes it great? The sound's really superb at low to relatively high volumes and you don't miss stereo at the short distances you'd normally listen at. Whomping woofer and tight tweeter; better to put your value upon a higher quality mono speaker system than a lesser sounding stereo setup.The six \D\ batteries seem to last forever. Plus, these mega-reception puppies are tough. My twenty year old model, area of manufacture unknown as I long ago glued 1/4\ foam all over it so I could just throw it in the back of my truck, can't be determined. Incidentally, this radio once fell seven feet from a storage shelf onto the concrete floor of my workshop; still works great, 'tho I had to find a new antenna.Don't know about these Chinese Model III's being advertised re. reliability.

The human ear is better than a signal strength meter, with the constantly varying signal strength of distant AM stations. With manual, you can pinpoint the area of best reception without being locked into the overly large digital \channel steps\ of 10 kHz as used here for the N & S Americas.

2856,7172,"I've was looking for a really good AM radio for sometime, I live in the mountains of NW Maine and wanted to get the Portland and Boston talk radio stations.  I came across the CC-Crane radio and was about to buy it when I  saw the Superadio in thier catalog listed as the best value for the money.  I searched around on the internet and really never found a better price  than CC because they include shipping, until Amazon had it for under $40.  I also found several websites where amatuer radio hobbyists were discussing  their thoughts on this Radio and how they got in and tweaked it to improve  the performance and the inaccurate tuning display.  These guys all gave it  a thumbs up over much more expensive radios.  I have found its performance  to be excellent, although its rather cheaply made, its price reflects that.  I have also obtained an AM antenna called the Selecta-Tenna.  This has  improved the already good performance of the Superadio even further, in  fact a cheap boom box was working better than the un-antennaed Superadio  with this antenna.  I would recommend this antenna to anyone who uses the  Superadio to get distant AM stations.",Best Price anywhere and best AM value for the money,"1,4"
1699,7182,"I must have gotten a lemon because this radio is one of the worst I've ever owned. I bought it a year ago hoping to get good reception at my work inside a metal & concrete building. It did not work except for the stongest of stations. So I brought it home. At first everything was fine, however, sometimes tuning in a station was difficult. Then the dreaded clicking started happening. I would get a loud fast clicking that made hearing the station impossible & it would click faster the more I turned up the volume. The clicking was intermittent at first & very anoying when trying to listen to a game. Now it happens all the time. The radio itself is very cheaply made especially compaired to an older supertuner II someone else I know has....the weight is nearly a quarter of the old one. Obviously I cannot recomend this large bulky radio with awful reception.",Terrible,3

I listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other *cheap* boom box type radios cannot cut through the computer generated RF but this one discriminates and I can hear the stations. Also, the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes. It is also very inexpensive. I would recommend to anyone.",I've had this radio for a few years...,1

2858,7197,"I have purchased two Super Radios over the years.  The first was purchased in the 1980s.  The second was purchased just over ten years ago.  Both worked well, but the case was worn, and the batteries fell out.  For that reason I purchased another Super Radio through Amazon.com that arrived last month.  I was very disappointed.  The AM band worked reasonably well, but not as well as either of the earlier sets.  However the FM band was defective.  The radio did not adequately discriminate between FM stations, especially in the lower part of the FM band.  Two stations at a time could be heard, though one would have more volume than the other.  Tuning was difficult over the whole FM dial, and there was usually a slight distortion.  The band width switch did not really help.  I was greatly disappointed, and returned the radio.  I often visit rural areas with low signal strength, and I wanted a fully functional Super Radio. Unfortunately, I did not obtain one, and it was been returned.

It seems as if there's a problem aligning these radios  properly in GE's Chinese factory.  On my sixth radio, I finally got a  sample with fairly balanced performance, although still not as good as the  discontinued SuperRadio 2 (sorry).  In spite of this, and the poor tuning  accuracy, the radio is still a good value.  To restate others, battery life  is long and audio is excellent.  Buy from someplace with a good return  policy.

505,7248,"Simply put, this radio blows away every other radio (about 10 of them) I own on the AM band. I bought the GE Superadio III because I had heard that it was good at bringing in distant radio stations. Living in NYC, this is not normally a problem, however I am a big fan of Coast To Coast AM and WABC 770 does not carry the show on Friday nights for some reason. In order to get my fix, I needed a strong radio to get the job done. I don't recall where I had heard about the Superadio, but I decided to take a shot with one and ordered it. Amazon got it to me quickly, and I was quite excited when it arrived. My first impressions were about the size, and weight of the radio. The thing is big, and with batteries, quite heavy for a portable radio. The styling also screams 1980's, but that's ok. This machine was not made for looks, it was made for reception. After powering it up at the office for the first time, I decided to check it out against my two office radios. The problem at work is that we get very poor reception because it is a steel and brick building with no windows by the office area. Neither of our other two office radios could effectively pick up WABC, but the GE picked it up with no problem at all, crystal clear. The real test came up on the first friday night, it was time for coast to coast and I located a station in North Carolina at (I think) 1100 AM. Sounded as if it were next door. The radio had no problem picking the station out from between two strong NYC stations located nearby on the dial.To sum it up, I've been astounded at the reception I get with this radio. Currently, I can easily scan the dial and pick up half the country it seems. Also, based on other comments, I appear to have gotten lucky with a pretty accurate dial.My only complaint is that the battery case is rather flimsy and it doesn't take much to pop the door off.If you're thinking about investing in a great AM radio, then this is the one! It really doesn't need an external antenna in my opinion, but consider this. If you're looking for the ultimate in AM reception and your torn between the Superadio and CCradioplus. You can get the Superadio and one hell of an external antenna together for less than the CCradioplus.","A super, superadio",1

Being able to move it out of the way to grap a sip of coffee, or to sneeze, all without being an audible distraction to the person on the other end, is wonderful!The ear piece delivers terrifically clear sound quality.  No tin-sound, no reverb, no crackle...just pure, clean words!

I heard yesterday that these are my dad's favorite! Yay!  He's used his Uniden HS910 set for several months [the others never met his standards for that long], and he still loves them.

I can walk around the house and listen to either Howard or the Rolling Stones channel through out, using one boom box.There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these.* A) * Set the volume going into the transmiter higher. 2) Low volume in will cause popping and fading. Very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down. 2) Higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level. When you increase the volume on the speakers, you are amplifying the NOISE as well as the music. Makes sense, right?B) The power cord is also part of the antenna, so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception. I used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands. The cord runs straight down like a verticle antenna.C) The speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence. You can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers (speakers). Fine tune them for the best reception in your location. This may take a few adjustsments. Remember, cellphones, WIFI etc can all interfere!I tried plugging the transmitter into my stereo's headset jack, but it didn't work well, because the output was too low. I'm going to cut the plugs off of the Y adapter or make an adapter with bare wires and try using them as the rear (effects) channel of my home theater.I love these speakers and use them everyday. They could be a little better, but I still love them! I'd give them 5 stars if they were a little louder, a little better tone wise and the reception range was a little better.

542,7745,"I have had these headphones for more than six months, and I regret purchasing them.  My principal complaint is the very awkward placement of the battery pack/sound canceling module, which is about halfway between the headphones and the jack, and which always seems to tangle the wires or otherwise get in the way.  Also, there is some defect in the wiring which causes a sharp crackling noise when the headphone wires are moved and the noise canceling feature is \on.\",Look elsewhere,"2,3"

1735,7763,These noise-cancellation headphones are the cheapest that I could find for my transatlantic flight to Ireland.  I had another pair previously for my flight to Hawaii from the east coast.  The over the ear design reduces cabin noise and doesn't start to bother you for about 6 hrs of constant wear.  Take a break for food and you're ready to go again.  They had reasonable sound and adequate noise-cancellation to drown out crying babies and cabin noise.  Add earplugs if you need total quiet to sleep.  The price was right for my occasional needs and for kids.,Great Headphones for the Price,1
544,7764,"Very nice.  I used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where I needed a headset and microphone combination.  I remembered that these had that feature - it was not one I could figure out on my own though, I did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at, but maybe that's just me.  Anyway, once they were all set, they functioned wonderfully!",Excellent Home Audio Addition!,1

I could hear a conversation between my kids in the next room, speaking in normal voices, while listening to music on these headphones.  They're collapsible, which makes them less than sturdy and constantly falling off.  They're not a bad headphone if you compare them to the cheaper types that fall in the $10-15 range, but the fact that they claim to \eliminate up to 95% of ambient sound\ is quite ridiculous.  Don't waste your money.",Noise cancellation?  What a joke!,"2,3"

2908,7787,"These relatively inexpensive noice-cancelling headphones really does its job well, remarkable how it reduces the cabin noice on a Boing 747 by at least 50%. It's actually possible with these to follow a movie being shown and understand all that's being said without too much concentration. As for the sound quality, they're probable nothing fancy but they produce a good deal more bass than your standard in-flight headset. My only problem with these is the comfort issue. After 1-2 hour of wearing my ears gets red/annoyed. This is because they rest on the ear itself where I would've preferred an over-the-ear solution. I am happy I got them however, great value for the money, the Sony solution is way WAY more expensive and I just need them for an occational movie in flight.","Amazing technologi, less good comfort....","1,3"
2909,7794,"We bought these to soothe our nerves during flying.  I found that they function very well as headphones.  The noise cancellation circuitry adds a very low level white noise that can only be heard in quiet passages in quiet environments, but the circuit can be switched off and the headphones function as any unpowered phones do.  Sound reproduction is good, the noise cancellation works mainly in the lower octaves (rumble and roaring noises) which is where you need the help when traveling.  Higher frequency noises like voices are only slightly attenuated.  This may be a design strategy which makes sense, but is also likely much easier (cheaper) to execute than full-bandwidth attenuation.  Very helpful for our intended purpose.",Nice execution for the money,1
546,7798,"As someone that has tried the more expensive Bose noise cancelling headphones, I can honestly say that the Maxell NC-II are well worth the money.  I recently wore these headphones with relatively high expectations, and feel that they performed well for the money spent.You can tell that these headphones feel/appear made inexpensively - lots of plastic components.  Take care of them, and they should last.  Don't forget to grab a couple AAA batteries, as they are not included.",Great price to performance ratio,1
547,7803,"I was going on a business trip, and didn't have time to get these in through Amazon.  I had a previous version that went bad after four years, so I bought another pair (through Walmart).Maxell really cheapened these up.  The phone jack was flimsy, and started having problems after only three uses in my laptop.  The fit around the ears was nowhere near as nice as the previous pair I had, and there seemed to be an intermittent (more on than off) constant tone around 9000 hz that was quite irritating.Save yourself the time and aggravation with this pair, spend the money on a nice Audio-Technica unit (like I'm going to do) and get something that meets your needs for the long haul.",Not worth your time,2
2910,7804,"I am not an audiophile, but I do care about the sound I hear. I bought this headset last week mainly for the time I spend removing snow in winter. I wanted a headset that covers my ears well, while sounding OK. I thought this noise cancelling phone would be a great choice, especially because my snowblower is terribly loud. Well, it does cover my ears comfortably well, but unfortunately thats all that is good about this headset. It isnt particularly great sounding, and the biggest disappointment was noise cancellation - rather the lack of it. It is hard to perceive much difference between NC being on or off!! It does suppress some, so I know it is on, but it can hardly suppress anything real. I quickly gave up any hope about its use with snowblower, but I then found it cant do much about the sound of my home's furnace as well - which is barely audible even without a headset.. bummer.I have a Sony MDR-NC6 that I have been using for the past 2 years or so. It still works great, just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear. If that is not one of your criteria, I highly recommend it. It sounds way better, is cheaper (at least now it is), noise cancellation works great too. See my review there.",not really a noise cancelling headset,"2,3,4"
548,7806,"These are great headphones while they are still working. The noise cancellation is adequate (I have used them on an airplane and in other noisy environments and they manage to cancel out almost all of the environmental noise, and they are also manufactured in such a way that the band between the headphones has somewhat of a forward lean so that you xcan recline in your airplane seat and not be resting against the headphone band). However, having owned these headphones for almost 2 years, I had to replace them several times. This was precipitated by one side of the headphones suddenly not transmitting sound, so I would only be getting sound to my right ear and not my left. This might have been caused by the somewhat bulky battery case that is inline with the headphone wire itself and puts some strain on the wire whenever you wind up the cord to put them away. Luckily, Wal-Mart carried these for a number of years, so I was able to keep exchanging them whenever they ceased functioning properly. Overall, if you have $40 to spend and you're not planning on having these be your lifelong headphones, they are a good buy, and you won't be disappointed with the sound quality.",Mixed Review,1

These headphones are comfortable for like about an hour or so, but wearing them for a long time will make your ears heart A LOT. There is also another flaw. IF you have a small head, these headphones make you look like idiot because they are exceptionally big, and look weird, kind of like some alien communication device.Overall though there is nothing extremely bad about these headphones and they will suit mostly everyone who buys them, and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound.",Jensen,1
578,8078,"The Acoustic Research HT181 Optical Digital Cable is a wonderful choice if you are looking to take your stereo system to the next level.As I've come to notice, it seem that the only cables out there where the Monster cables. Not true. The great news is, for a cheaper price and without sacrificing quality, the Acoustic Research cable is the perfect match for those of us who are watching our money and want a good quality product.If you have a DVD player (mines an RCA...) that has an optical audio plug and a stereo receiver that receives optical audio, don't wait any longer!! Stop using those RCA left and right plugs and buy an optical cable.The AR HT181 cables will expand you're listening please due to the fact that every speaker in your system (front: left/right,  back: left/right, Center & subwofer) will receive it's own independent audio signal creating incredible audio effect and enhance your listening pleasure to any DVD movie.To try and be super technical about these cables and compare them to Monsters is overkill and every room has it's own unique acoustics. The point being . . . if you're looking for a digital optical cable and are looking for a good price these should be an excellent choice.The construction of the cables are good.

2936,8090,"... i found that this headphone is not what i thought about itafter reading about it on the net and the booklet included with theheadset at the first sight.According to the manual the range is 300feet. This is not true in the case of a scenario in which you use theheadphone with walls e.t.c between the transmitter and theheadphone. I placed the transmitter on the top floor of my house andthe sound quality was very good in the area of about 60 * 50 feet onmy top floor with concreate walls in between and wood doors, but wheni went downstairs, the real thing showed up. While moving around icould easily hear hissing sound which disappers when i stopwalking. Moreover the signal also became weak. I adjusted thefrequency from the headphone but of no use. So whats the use, even iwent up and changed the frequnency of the headphone and thetransmitter again, but when i came back same was the result. The soundbecomes louder when i came under the room in which i placed thetransmitter. Allover it showed variable sound and i was just about 30feet away from the transmitter with concrete walls in between.Thesecond thing is that i went in the opposite direction of the room onthe same floor in which i placed the transmitter and when i was about20 feet away with 2 concrete walls in between and many glass windows,the signal was over. I belive that the 300 feet range is a marketingstrategy or if its possible, its in an open space like a ground. In ahouse or through walls, its impossible.The headphone comes with 3NiCD, rechargable batteries which are placed in the headset and theheadphones are connected to the transmitter with a charging cable. Thetransmitter is then connected to the power outlet to charge theheadphones. The initial charge is 24 hours (Plays 5 to 6hours). Average charge is 10-12 hours (Plays 3-4 hours) and ExtendedCharge is 16-18 hours (Plays 5-6 hours). There is no indication of anytype that the batteries are being charged on both the headphones andthe transmitter.The headphones comes with Y cable adapter, ACadapter, charging cable and headohone adapter plug also. Theaccessories are enough to plug anywhere.This thing is made in Chinaand the quality is not bad, the headphones fit very easily and arecomfortable enough to fit over the ear but the grip of the headphonesover the head is not so tight, if you look down the headphones alsolooses some of its original location and they might fall from yourhead if you jerk your head down.The transmitter is very lightweight and its quality is not so good, moreover its not so powerful,but it works till the distance i have specified with very goodresults. The antenna of the transmitter is very light weight and itcan break easily if not proper care is taken.Over all theheadphones are of good quality material but not the transmitter.Therange is not 300, its about 70 to 90 feet (works; very good in thisrange) with walls e.t.c in between and in an open space it ismore. The sound quality is very good if you are on the same floor ofthe transmitter but distorts if you go on different floor.The priceis high as compared to the product.Note: This is a totally clearreview of the product deflecting my own experience. I am not in theopposition of this company or product neither i have tried any otherwireless headphones of this or some other company.

(A did not like  a Sony wireless headphone for that reason.)There is some adjustment of  the controls (to match the frequency of the base and the headphones)  needed, but it does not bother me.

She took the unit to Circuit City and they plugged it in and had the same problem.

583,8132,"The features are great: the machine beeps when you have a call waiting  alert (to replace the traditional &quot;beep&quot; tone that Call Waiting  made that Caller ID takes away), it flashes a light when you have a new  call so that when you get home you can see immediately if you have received  any new calls, and the display is nice and large. The unit itself is very  easy to use.However, my unit always indicates that I have a  &quot;beep&quot; (Call Waiting) but there isn't any! At least once every 15  minutes per call it does this. It is extremely annoying. It has gotten to  the point where I don't even check for other calls anymore because I have a  feeling it's just the machine malfunctioning.I should have listened to  the other two reviewers who gave negative reviews.

It has the absolute worst sensitivity and only quietly beeps (at its loudest volume) when a police car is about 50 feet in  front of your vehicle.  I always see the cop before the detector begins to  beep.  Ka band sensitivity is even worse!  With this band, it beeps only  once as you are passing the cop, and not before. This is no joke.  I took  my first ESD 6700 back to the store because I thought that it was  defective, but the second one was just as bad.  As the signal gets  stronger, the beep frequency does not increase, it only beeps about three  times for about three seconds very slowly until you pass the threat.

587,8151,"This is a nice product.  It has many good features and given it were a little better put together it would be a perfect product.The problems I found with the product are as follows:1) The VOX is useful but doesn't always work as one would hope.  It has a tendency to pick up every little sound and if you turn down the sensitivity then the VOX won't pick up every word so you have choppy transmissions.  Examples Too High : &quot;(air from walking, breathing) Hey this is so-and-so and I am back at camp. (more air from walking, breathing) BLEEP(end of transmission signal) (more breathing and air)&quot; Too Low : &quot;This BLEEP so-and-so BLEEP camp BLEEP&quot; It might be possible to find a perfect setting, but I sure haven't found it yet and I have been playing around with them.2) The PTT button is kind of sensitive.  When I use the PTT (which is always since VOX would pick up any and every paintball shot) the button is very similar to the buttons on my FRS-100 because they have to be pushed hard and right in the center.  Press any bit off of the center of the button and you will get choppy transmission similar to the ones in the VOX example.Don't get me wrong, they are kinda nice and if you are willing to put up with the PTT button and the VOX, they are wonderful....",Nice but far from perfect,1

Recently I submitted a loss to Belkin due to a power surge resulting from a lightning storm at my home office.  This product guarantees replacement at an \Unlimited Amount!\ I now know, after experiencing Belkin's claim/customer service, how they can make that promise. It's quite simple to make empty statements.  In fact, they should add, \Comes with a FREE CAR!\ because Belkin's response to my claim, via a pattern letter, was \there is no physical information to support your connected equipment warranty claim with Belkin Corporation.\I had 3 components plugged into this suppressor.  Belkin failed to protect 2 of the 3.  So I'm left with a $... loss, including the original surge protector purchase.  That's right, you mail the surge protector to Belkin, so they can evaluate their product, and they don't even send you a replacement!  Not that I'd use it because their product does not work.  How do I know with certainty that their product doesn't work?  On the same date of the loss I had, APC products protected 17 of 18 items in my home office.  My only APC loss was a 27\ TV.  Also, when I contacted APC regarding my claim, I spoke to a person, and I had a replacement suppressor arrive at my home within 3 days.  In contrast, when I contacted Belkin regarding my loss, after a phone maze, at my cost (no 800 number for claimants) I was directed to the Internet to file my claim.  Two weeks later I get a pattern letter from Belkin denying any product failure on their part.Bottom line APC had better products, and provides better service.

When I purchased the power strip it came with a Lifetime Warranty. I contacted Belkin to use the warranty - the Belkin responsevia email, was that what they gave me was a LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANY and that since they are no longer producing this power strip they will not honor their warranty. They sent me a link to purchase another one. So I called their Customer Care Dept. at 800-223-5546, and they told me that the Limited Lifetime Warranty is only good while they are producing the product and after that they don't support or replace the defective product.

The cable I got REEKED of chemical, plasticy, rubbery odor that was HIGHLY unpleasant.  This wasn't the case with my 25 foot cable!  Perhaps they cheaped out on the jacket?  Or just simply changed suppliers?  I have no idea.  But, if you have a sense of smell at all, avoid this cable.  I ended up buying a Dynex 50' cat 5e ethernet cable from Best Buy for too much money.  What can I say, I needed it right then.  Something very similar is sold on Amazon for a lot less, but it doesn't look exactly the same (although it probably is).

I was agast..how could this be?  was I wrong about KLH all these years?

1818,9231,"I purchased my pair of KLH 970A's about six years ago to use as rear surround speakers.  My primary reason for buying them was their price - who could resist trying a pair of speakers at this price?  I have enjoyed these speakers almost every day for the past six years, and they still amaze me with their quality.  The build quality is superb, and unlike some fellow reviewers, I have found the speaker brackets to be well made and very useful.  Speaker stands and brackets are one of the most overpriced audio accessories available - so it's amazing that KLH provides brackets for the 970A, especially at this price.The three-way design is somewhat a novelty at this size (the woofer is only 4\) but the 970A produces full, rich sound that belies its diminuitive size.  But a key to enjoying these speakers is understanding their limitations.  This should be well understood, but some people still believe that a non-ported mirco-bookshelf speaker should be able to produce strong, heavy bass.  KLH rates the frequency response at 90Hz to 20kHz, which seems accurate - and accordingly, deep bass extension should not be expected.  Using the 970A with a subwoofer will provide the extended bass response, if that is desired.  Highs are crisp and detailed, and unlike what one reviewer said, there is plenty of midrange.  I have also used one 970A as a center channel speaker with wonderful results.  The crisp, detailed sound from these speakers is simply unbelievable.Although versatile and useful in many applications, the 970A works best as a surround channel speaker for in-home use.  Outdoors, however, the 970A is great as a front-channel speaker.  Many people shy away from KLH products because of their low price - but the 970A shouldn't be passed up.  Price is certainly not a determinant of quality in this case, and the 970A is a wonderful little speaker.",The little speaker that could...,1

1820,9290,They work great.  They are very clear and definitly go 2 miles.  This product is well worth the money.,Review for Talkabout 250,1
1821,9295,I bought a pair of these for a Wednesday-to-Friday trip to Disneyland in May 2000. I felt it would be a good &quot;acid test&quot; since there might be enough interference from other FRS radios and all the structures at the  park. The TalkAbout performed surprisingly well; but I also realized that  it lacked some features which I needed. Here's my best breakdown of the  issues. RANGE: Exceeded my expectations. I was able to get a clear  reception from outside the Candy Cane Inn (Harbour and Katella) to the area  just outside Small World. I haven't calculated the distance but I think  it's about 0.5 miles (you may want to check this). We got a bit of static  from the Disneyland Hotel monorail station to the Matterhorn. CLARITY: I  can't really compare this model to other FRS radios (haven't tried them)  but the only time we had problems understanding one another was when we  would get &quot;stepped-on&quot; by less-considerate FRS-users on the same  channel and code. The CTCSS codes (aka &quot;privacy codes&quot;) were  effective in squelching out other transmissions. I recall only receiving  two calls from other parties on Friday when the park was really crowded.  The microphone was remarkably sensitive. I had the unit clipped to my  camera bag strap which ran across my chest (about 5-6 inches under my chin)  and was able to talk normally while depressing the transmit button with my  index finger. POWER CONSUMPTION: The Kirkland (Costco) alkalines lasted  about 29 hours until early Friday. (Yes. You turn them on and leave them on  in standby mode.) The battery power indicator was helpful. We probably  spent 20% of our time transmitting and the rest on standby. STURDINESS: I  dropped one on the concrete and it landed on its bottom. It was fine. The  antenna and case are ruggedized but likely not indestructible. EASE OF USE:  Even the technically-challenged members of our party had no problem  &quot;guessing&quot; how the controls worked. Motorola's button layout is  one of the better ones (but I could imagine having some problems with the  smaller buttons if you were skiing and had gloves). PROBLEMS: The only  problem we had was that there was a lot of channel congestion on Friday at  the park. The park can swell up to 77k guests in a day so the 532  combinations can get used up fast. SUMMARY AND WISHLIST: Am happy overall  but I think I'll be returning these to get a more expensive unit which  vibrates when receiving incoming calls (for those more quiet environments).  I'd also prefer a real splash-resistant unit if I was out on a rainy day. I  don't think I need a smaller palm-sized unit as this size fit me just fine.  The TalkAbout performed well enough that other members of our group decided  to buy FRS radios for themselves in preparation for the next family reunion  at the mouse-house. We also found these useful for exchanging driving  directions when leaving the park for some fancy restaurants in Orange  County.,Performed well at Disneyland,1

We now own five TalkAbouts, and just purchased 2 of the 250's this fall for evaluation. I  find that this model is an incremental enhancement from the TalkAbout +.  The range seems a little better (though the cases are identical); Motorola  yanked the absolutely useless voice synthesizer out of the Plus and  replaced it with a useful scanning and lock function. Another reader whined  about &quot;not being able to scan subcodes&quot; -- apparently thinking  codes are channels. They are just used for squelching other conversations  -- pushing the monitor button lets you hear everything on the channel. We  chose these over Cobra's FRS products because they stand up to the abuse  and needs of cyclists (especially CHANGING BATTERIES!). A great inexpensive  solution that has saved our necks several times.",These puppies have enhanced our guided cycling tours,1
672,9303,"I love these radios.  I have used these at the beach, shopping, camping, etc., and find them extremely useful.  They are clear, and easy to use.  They also work great between cars if you are on a long trip with multiple  cars.The only warning is that even though they are extremely sturdy,  just don't get them wet!  They are not good for fishing or canoeing trips,  or anywhere else where they are likely to be exposed to water.  If splashed  heavily with water, or, heaven forbid, submerged, they will malfunction and  become useless.  Unfortunately this happened to me.  Motorola was great  about fixing them, but moisture damage is not covered under the warrantee.  They did sell me a brand new replacement for $40, which was a pretty good  deal, considering.","Great Radio, but don't get it wet!","1,3"
3013,9311,I have a small fleet of the Motorola Talkabout 250's (12 of them).  I use and abuse them regularly and I have not ever found a better radio for the money.

673,9326,"This model is quite slow, but it's not Iomega's fault, but just a result of it using the parallel port. The usage of the parallel port also uses CPU cycles, so while the thing is copying data, you might not be able to  anything else but watch the egg timer.Spend your money on a CD-R  instead. A CD-R drive might cost a little bit more, but the media is MUCH  cheaper, holds MUCH more data, and is more durable than the Zip  format.If you must buy a Zip drive, don't buy the parallel port model,  it's far too slow for impatient people (like me.)",Buy a CD-R instead,"2,3"
3014,9331,"I have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive-  My university's graphics computers have zip drives, the local Kinkos have zip drives in their computers, my parents even have a zip drive now.  Its a nice, accepted standard, and for the price the disks read fast and work well- unlike 3.5  floppies, no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me. Zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your (shirt) pocket without  damage.The strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the 120 MB  super-drive, which is a drive that is backwards-compatible with 1.6 MB  (traditional)3.5 floppies, so you can totally replace your old floppy drive  and still have it when you need it.  A couple years ago it was expected  that this drive would blow Iomega zip out of the picture, but  super-floppies haven't really caught on.In terms of exchanging data  between computers in the same house, it is suprisingly simple to run an  ethernet network instead- and there are other advantage besides transfering  files- such as printer sharing and web sharing.-Note.

The blank minidisks are easy to handle and once you play around for a bit recording  is easy. The quality is identical to CD quality except when using the  digital optical cable in which case the sound quality is unsurpassed. This  was my first time buying anything besides a book online and although I was  a little skeptical about it at first Amazon came through. The product was  well packaged and arrived three days after I ordered. A definite buy for  anyone interested in top quality sound and convenience.",Wonderful!,1

675,9378,"I get my 722 for Christmas and it has been a great product in the few weeks that I've had it.  The sound is always clear, the bass does not drown out the treble as is the case with some Sony models.  This model does not  have the UTOC error exhibited by the 702 and by some other earlier models.  Moreover, recording is very easy.  I don't have a digital output device  available, so I use analog recording.  I can take a line direct from the  sound card of my PC to record my mp3 collection on MiniDisc.  This  convenience is heightened by the fact that this unet will not skip under  most normal circumstances.  I find that for use in the car or while  jogging, it will not skip.  The sound is perfectly clear (much better than  the Sony, Panasonic, or Aiwa models I tested at Circuit City.)  I highly  recommend the MD-MS722.  Its sound quality leads the field, it almost never  skips, and, personally, I like the appearance as well.  However, it is not  the smallest on the market.

1823,9385,I recently bought the sharp minidisc Player and it suprised me; greatly. It is great for recording Mp3's and songs off of Cd's.  But one thing about it is it's sort of fat for a mini disc recorder. The rating fits perfectly  because every thing else makes up for the thickness.  It is also easy to  take around instead of a Cd player. Mini discs gets damaged a lot harder  than A cd because of the outside case. Tip: If you a Cd recorder and mess  up the Cd by putting pauses or space in between.  You can clean it up with  the MD player. Best portable sound around!,Bigger Than Great,1

Thought it might just come and go but after listening to this guy, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that mini-disc is here to stay.

Get the Sharp MDMS722!",Best purchase of the year,1
3016,9391,"Like most people, the minidisc was a distant memory in my mind, stored  away with the likes of Crystal Pepsi and the McDLT. However, while looking  for a way to move my MP3s to a portable device, I stumbled across the Sharp  722. Reluctantly, I purchased it, and in a word, it's incredible.I'm not  an audiophile by any sense of the imagination. But to my ears, the 722  makes incredibly high quality copies of any music source. I found it easy  to attach the recorder to my computer and move MP3 files to MD. Granted,  this isn't as fast as a Rio, or Nomad... 74 minutes of MP3s take 74 minutes  to move to MD. However, the time difference is more than made up in the  ability to switch mixes instantly.Although prices are falling, flash  memory is still prohibitively expensive for most people. However, with  three dollars worth of MDs, you can record more than two hours of digital  quality music, plus some.  That's the more than double the maximum capacity  of most similarly priced portable MP3  units. And recording couldn't be  easier. All you do it turn on the external source, sit back and relax. The  722 does most of the work, including dividing tracks. Then, you are free to  name and edit tracks, which is made much easier thanks to the jog ring on  top of the unit. Essentially, the MD is like a super-high quality cassette  tape for the 21st century. It gives you all the convenience and audio  quality of CDs, with the customizable of tape.With all the included  features taken into consideration,  I'd say the Sharp 722 is the biggest  value in portable audio out there today. Compare it with many of Sony's  units, and you'll find it's more feature packed, more user friendly, more  durable, and much more economical. I would highly recommend this unit for  anyone looking for a high quality music solution.",Simply amazing sound,1
678,9401,"I bought the Sharp MD-MS722 for recording my dj mixes, but use it for all of my audio recording. Making a recording is very easy, and the buttons are easy to press. While some higher models have the auto-level, which sets the recording level to the correct setting even if the input changes this model does not have one. I would perfer the auto-level control, but from my experience adjusting the level manual is sometimes easier (in a dj mixing enviroment as a example). Another great feature is the &quot;jog-dial&quot; which makes typeing out a MiniDisc name very fast, and easy. While this is my first MiniDisc recorder, I have no complants and find this format will be my choice for all recordings, analog or digital.As a note to record your cd, just record with the &quot;sync&quot; option on. This will start, stop recording and even change tracks to match the cd. Some cd's will have problems, like a mix cd that has no end to each of the tracks. Another nice feature is the digital in, when recording from a digital source (DVD, CD player) you can get very clear sound, and easy recording set-up.The only problem I find with this recorder is, 1- the lack of a backlit screen on the main player(it does have a backlit remote). It's not a major problem, just nice to see more details than the remote shows while in a dark room. Something to point out is that this recorder uses a &quot;slot&quot; ejecting style or the common &quot;clam-shell&quot; design. Some people like this, and some don't. Personally I like the slot style more since it give the recorder a less fragile feel. Overall the recorder is very well built, using metal for the main body and after playing MiniDiscs I doubt I will go to tapes or cd for my personal listening.If you don't have a home recorder, or need to make some high quality recording try this recorder. One last thing to remember is that after making a recording, you must not move the recorder while it is making the &quot;TOC&quot; table or contents file. This will cause you to get a bad recording.",great value,1

Yes, I said two years - and I still only paid about $75 more than the list price on this discontinued model.About a year in, I got the infamous  --- UTOC error --- on a disk. Went to Best Buy and bought a Maxell MD  cleaner (after taking the silly thing apart, etc. trying to &quot;fix&quot;  it). Ran the cleaner three times, and everything was fine. I can still  record, but I have to clean it more often now (every couple of months), or  I get the errors (or skipping disks) again. I run my 702 between 8 and 48  hours per week.All I can say is: if you have a cleaner for your CD  player, and your DVD player, and your VCR, and a cleaner for your cassette  player, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR MD?

(syncro-record, optical record, plus full track editing tools)  However...after only a couple of months it has begun to skip badly and is  basically  a $300.00 paperwieght.  I kept it clean, out of the sun and only  played it a couple hours a day and it is completely broken.  I thought the  lithium-ion battery might need replacement, but I got a rude surprise when  I found out they are ONLY available from Sharp via mail-order and cost  **$50.00**.  The optional AA battery pack is also only available from Sharp  and is on back order 'till August (maybe).  I have to wait 2 months to find  out if the battey is even the problem, and if it isn't, then the thing is  truly worthless after only 100 hours or so of gentle use.  This is  immensely frustrating because the unit is really fantastic when it is  working correctly.  The little remote controller is super cool, and it  comes with really good headphones.

The shots look great on an island, but not in the snow.  My boyfriend used this camera and I used my own Nikon to take the same shots, and his were much bluer. We both used Kodak film and got it developed at the same place. I also agree with the flimsy comment down below, and I don't understand how Olympus can claim this is a water resistant camera, if light is getting through to the film it can't be air-tight.  Despite the drawbacks, it is the smallest and lightest 35mm camera I have ever seen.  The slide-across lens cover is great, b/c it means you don't need a case for the camera.

It is not very good at protecting the palm from inadvertent power-on. It also pins down the up arrow, so alarms barely sound before they're silenced. Worse than that, the rail that holds it to the case is attached with a strip of rubber that is ripping off. This is probably because the rail fit is pretty tight and the edges around where the rail inserts into the Palm are a little sharp. Taking the palm in and out of the case daily (which you need to do to sync or charge) has worn down the rubber. I'm thinking of asking for a refund.","Power turns on, rail falls off","2,3"

689,9503,"Okay, I bought this case with my Palm V in fall of 1999. Loved it then, love it now. The pockets hold all kinds of stuff, and with the simple tab/loop closure it is quite expandable. The case has worn very well, acheiving a kind of supple patina with constant carrying and shoving it in and out of coat pockets. Stylish and slim, just like the descriptor says.However, I tend to drop my Palm V all the time. Well, at least once a week anyway, and for a year, that was okay. The case protected it and all was good. Then one day I dropped it on a tile department store floor, and the popping sound it made on contact was decidedly different. Sure enough, I had spider-webbed the screen with fissures and all was lost.Then I replaced the unit and kept the case, only to have it happen again (this time on hardwood floors in my home). Okay, I'm a klutz, what can I tell you? But again the case was not protection enough. In the first bad incident, my Palm landed on a corner and in the second it landed on its face (IN the case). this time the damage was not as severe, but the screen was basically shot.Again I repaired/replaced the unit and now, hundreds of dollars in damage after my purchase of the Palm V, I live in constant fear of tile and wood floors and parking lots everywhere. I am searching for a new, more durable case, but one with the same look and feel (no zippers!) just isn't out there. So buy this case, but be warned. You'll need to be careful.","Terrific, but really not protective",1
690,9504,"Unlike my other reviews which usually take up a page or so, this product is rather straight forward.  First and foremost I must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case, which is also manufactured by  3Com, in both form and function.  Second it can hold credit cards and money  to be used as a second wallet, although it is not a great idea to use it as  a primary substitute.  And thirdly, the hard case is about ten dollars more  than the leather case and is not nearly as good.However, like all  things, it does have it's downsides.  It's biggest flaw, like with other  cases, is that it makes placing the Palm in the craddle (while still in the  case) a little more difficult.  You basically need to place the craddle up  on something (upside-down cup for example) and pull back both sides of the  case all the way and then you can recharge.  Secondly, the pockets are made  so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards  into or out of the pockets, which is why you might want to stick to a  regular wallet.  And thirdly, if you place the cased palm in a tight space  like a bag or something, there is a chance that the edge of the case will  hit the power button and cause it to turn on.  This is not a big deal since  it will shut off automatically after a minute or so, however it can become  annoying when you haven't charged your palm in a while and you find that  your battery is dying for some strange reason.All in all, you can't do  much better than this case for only $19.95, and while there may be more  expensive cases on the market, they are all variations of this simple  design.  However, I would say that it would be nice it 3Com or Palm would  make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection  on all sides, since something can get caught between your palm and the case  and end up scratching the screen (which almost happened to me).Final  thoughts: nice leather, don't expect it to take the same beating as the  hard case, but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm, don't shovel  out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case, get this nice leather one  instead.Revuman:  Stay Tuned for more Reviews...peace!","Nice case, OK wallet, better than the hard case","1,3"

But I got a good pioneer that's centered at 100htz, and they sound way better.  Very clear sound no matter how loud they are.  Tweeter sounds good, but there is some whine in the higher bass, but for running them to the max what do you expect?  I'm running 100 watts per channel through these, and they'll handle it very well, especially for the size.

But I have the KLH 10&quot; 120 watt sub and they are a perfect match.  Despite what people say about KLH I'm suprised with the quality of their products.

696,9639,"With a full 300 watts of raw power, this system is a steal at$200 ! However you should ask yourself if you will use it fully, andif you would prefer to trade some of the power you dont use for other features like auto reverse, better designed remote, more channels, better fidelity, lower price...I think the CDC 3900 loses out on all of these and more in comparison to others in the $150 price range. For a full comparison see the foll:For a quick look at competition in its price range and relative merits:1. Sharp CDBA 200 - 4 way speakers, 200 Watt and better sound quality though the CDBA 150 is nothing to sneeze at here...2. RCA RS2505 - Superior Sound quality. 5 CD changer. Good design . Reliability of RCA...3. JVC MX J100 - Loses out on ease of use, price and on Sound quality in my opinion. For the same $150 you can do better with Sharp CDBA 1504. Sharp CDBA 150 - Not a system for those who want an excellent remote or ease of use(it lacks auto-reverse for casettes for example) It does have an outstanding sound quality (50 watt /channel, but excellent sound fidelity)which I simply loved though. Same price as the JVC MX-J100. Downside: I did have problems with its antenna and had to get it replaced. Nevertheless for sheer outstanding sound quality I would rate this the best anyday at its $150 price5. Sony CFD Z550 - Sony reliability, ease of use. Downside : There's no comparing the sound quality. This one is way down and would compare with lower grade systems from the Sharp stable actually for its $150.6. Sharp CDC 3900 - 300 watts of power! Downside : older generation system, 2 channel, and $200 to boot. Sound Fidelity is not upto the mark.7.

I connect it and get on with my studying. Come dinnertime, I feel it's time to go, so I put the combo in the lock and IT WON'T UNLOCK.

The Amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you! Now I'm trippin out, so I start Googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo. Luckily, engagdet.com did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these things.I drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters, and come back to cut the cable. Takes me about 10 minutes to cut through, with a 7\ wire cutter (something a person can have in their pocket while you're away from your comp, spend 10 min, and be off with your laptop in their hands). Unfortunately, during that 10 min duration, someone reports me to the librarian because they think I'm trying to steal a laptop. I have to log in to the computer to prove that it's mine. Slightly embarrassing, but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo, but was pretty easy to cut through.SO, to recap, the reasons this is the WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED:1) IT WILL RANDOMLY CHANGE THE COMBO.

3047,9810,"I have been using GPS since they first came out... and this offers what a GPS should with little or no frills at a very reasonable cost.  No map, few routs (forget them anyway... I don't think anyone uses them) in an easy to use, menu driven package.  If you want to reliably return to fishing or camping spots, mark, save and return to locations then this unit will suffice.  For the small boat operator I guaranty it will pay for itself in gas in 100 miles of navigation.It has three navigation options: Plotting, which I use to search, CDI (course direction indication) which is useful in long straight line trips and a compass.  All are accessed through a single button (page) as is the easy to understand menu with waypoint management.Available accessories include a deck mount and power cord ( a bit pricey since it steps down 12volts to 8)both of these are must haves for marine use.","Simple, User Friendly",1

I wondered what motivated people to sit down and write these reviews...it seemed sort of suspicious to me.I fully understand now, and I hope to contribute as a way of saying thanks to the other reviewers.This unit is outstanding, as the other reviews state, and I found it particularly wonderful when combined with some free software called GPSU or GPS utility.  You can find it on the net (they are out of England).  You can download/upload waypoints and make a map.  Combination of these two are a must for the beginner to intermediate GPS user who camps, fishes, bikes, or visits places that they know they'll forget how to return to.  Just click &quot;GOTO&quot; and then highlight your waypoint and you can leave your brain at home.

709,9822,I have been using the SP III for around a year and it has worked out great.  I would agree that battery life leaves alot to be desired.  The other thing I would like to see is Macintosh support or an open development platform so others could write for the Mac.  I carry around an old laptop when on the road in my RV just to update the GPS.  It works great and gives you confidence while traveling in unknown areas.,Works pretty well,1
1849,9825,"...The SPIII seems to be the best available portable car navigation system.  It autoroutes, the maps seem accurate, and the talking directions are comforting.  I've been using mine for about a month.  It will take you to the nearest McDonald's easily.  The menu system works well with the right thumb once you get used to it.It's getting a bit long in the tooth, being over a year old as of Feb 2001.  There is no good competition to drive an even better model.  The shortcomings have been cataloged:  bad battery life, user interface that is expert friendly, but not necessarily novice friendly; a bit bulky.Here are a few quibbles that aren't as widely known: The battery insertion is fiendish:  every cell seems to go in the opposite direction of the one before.  It doesn't obey the intuitive rule that the spring should always go at the negative (-) end of the cell.  NiMH rechargables work well, but there is no NiMH setting on the battery type.  It won't charge your NiCD or NiMH cells while running on the car battery.  You need to do two resets to really clear the trip computer.  The trip computer isn't as useful as it could be (eg: multiple 'trips' and gas milage computation).  The internally calculated routes often don't agree with routes done on the computer using the MapSource software.  Did I mention it's bulky?Most of these problems could be addressed in a later model, but until someone comes out with something even close to the SPIII, expect Garmin to keep this one as the profitable top-of-the-line.  I would probably have paid [more] for a later-and-greater version,even though I'm basically happy with the SPIII.Hacker challenge: Take a cheap GPS and attaching it to a GameBoy Advance for color map display and talking output.-dB","SPIII best now, not perfect; be wary of reviews",4

If you miss a turn because the GPS is off your on your own, it takes the unit too long to catch up. It doesn't do well unless your on the Hwy. I was in a major traffic jam and needed to reroute, it couldn't do it. I eventually found my own way. I almost tossed the GPS on more than one occasion.",Not worth the price,"2,3"
3048,9839,"Before I bought the StreetPilot III I did a lot of searching around on the internet for a GPS system for my car and all signs pointed to Garmin. I bought my StreetPilot on e-bay for a considerable amount under the retail price. I also purchased the unlock code to all the DCAs because I am going to be heading down to the South in March. I was able to purchase the Streetpilot and the unlock code for less than the lowest advertised price for the StreetPilot by its self.Does the Streetpilot III work? It is simply amazing. I thought that the screen would be a bit small but it seems the perfect size for the dash. The mapping is extremely exact; even my street, which is a dirt road, was on the basemap. The voice commands are very helpfull, especially in heavy traffic when I do not want to take my eyes off the road. The voice commands are at times are a bit misleading, though. For example, at a rotary, which the GPS refers to as a roundabout (trying to be British?), the voice sometimes says, &quot;take second right,&quot; when the correct direction is either first or third right. However, the map is always correct and I just follow the route that I have programed by looking at the map. Except for instances at &quot;roundabouts&quot; the voice has been very accurate for me.Other than the voice commands at times being misleading there is not much wrong with the Streetpilot. The buttons on the unit are easy to use and their functions are easy to learn and follow.The tracking is amazing. Location is usually within 20 feet of my location. When driving, distances seem to be given just a bit sooner than they are. For example, when aproaching an exit the GPS voice will say, &quot;Exit in 400 feet,&quot; when the exit is 500-600 feet away. However, this is much better than being a bit off in the other direction. The GPS also gives speed and is always about half a mile per hour under what my spedometer reads, which seems extremely accurate.Programing with the Mapsource took a little while to learn, but that is the case with most new software. Once the data is loaded to the data card one can access it from the GPS unit. Finding locations is simple. Entering an address takes a couple of minutes or one can search for a city or town by pressing the menu button and choosing from a variety of ways of finding a location. Everything on the Streetpilot is layed out very well. Garmin did an excellent job designing the streetpilot and it is amazing that they can offer the StreetPilot for half of what Magelen charges for their 750, which I never really considered buying.I recently used my StreetPilot on a New Year's trip to Quebec. On the entire trip I never once had to consult a map or ask for directions; the Streetpilot took me from Boston to my hotel in Quebec City with ease.I would strongly recommend the Streetpilot III to anyone considering a portable GPS for their car. I'm sure that within a few years this unit may be half the price. However, the Streetpilot seems to be a unbeatable value to me. The Streetpilot can do everything that an in dash nav. system can do but at half the price. I definatley have no misgivings on purchasing my Streetpilot and look forward to the next time I head out on the road, knowing that I probably won't get lost again.","Best Portable Navigation, Period!","1,3,4"
1851,9845,I cannot say enough good things about Garmin products..

Very straight forward...,Garmin defined as excellence...,1
710,9848,"I bought this GPS a few years ago. As I work in the Army and my unit never fitted me with a military GPS, I decided to get one of my own. I was amazed then. It helped me out alot when trying to figure out my position. It's usefulness is limited in forests and in blizzards, which often is when you need the most. It was of course useless inside armored vehicles, but that's more than one can expect unless one has an external antenna.The GPS can usualy track your position within two or three minutes, which is pretty fast. However, if you keep it turned on, it will drain your four AA batteries pretty quick.I have always had the philosophy that one should NEVER solely trust a GPS. One should merely use it as a backup for a map and a compass. For this use, the Garmin GPS-12XL is just as good as you'll ever need it to be. However, the extra functions are rather primitive and probably most suited for fishers to mark their good spots.Having said all this, I must add that GARMIN has come out with several newer, better, more advanced and even cheaper GPS's. I recommend buying one of those instead. Think carefully and decide wisely.",Great... A few years ago,1

711,9864,"After recently purchasing a new Palm Vx, I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap. The Palm V hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment.The case attaches to the Palm V via the left stylus storage area. A stylus shaped piece attaches the Palm to the hinge in the case. The case itself opens like a book and allows the Palm to move much like a page in the book. Located behind the Palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper. The case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the IR port as well as the right stylus.Pros:1) Protects as advertised. The point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all, and this case delivers as advertised. The aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the Palm V tightly and securely.2) Allows for IR port usage while resting in case.3) Case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketCons:1) Heavy: One of the selling points for the Palm V series is the sleek, lightweight design. While this case may not seem like too much additional weight, the combination of the Palm V in the case is noticeably heavier. In fact my wife's Palm III and my Palm V weigh about the same now.2) Obstructive: hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself. A friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well.3) Hand holding the unit is more difficult. With the included leather flap, you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the Palm in one hand. The hard case does not fold back on itself, which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the Palm. This is especially annoying for me since I use my Palm frequently while standing or walking here and there.4) ...Overall, I think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her Palm in the smallest package. You will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers. At this time, I am still using the case, but I anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when I grow tired of the Cons listed above.Thanks for your time...",Good protection comes with a trade off,1
712,9865,"I was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first. Afterall, it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it. I no longer have doubts.I have unintentionally dropped my Palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces (brick, hard wood floor, etc.), and both the case and, more importantly, the Palm itself have come out completely unscathed.So, my advice is, if you are looking for real protection for your investment, just get one of these. There is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others (unless you are planning on using the Palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range...).Not surprisingly, the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish, too. You don't feel geeky pulling it out, and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.An excellent product.","Stronger Than One Would Think &#65533; Stylish, Too!",1

While I was certainly not expecting an elaborate, handcrafted, bulletproof Palm fortress, I was expecting a little more than a cheap plastic coat that feels like it came out of a vending machine.  This would make a great $7.95 item.  It makes a terrible $30-40 item.The plastic (the primary material of construction, supplemented by a thin layer of aluminum) probably feels more delicate than it really is.  But at the same time, who wants to spend that much money on something just to test and see if it really is stronger than it feels?  For me, the case never closed properly, and if there is some kind of ingenious spring mechanism, it certainly doesn't work on the case I bought.All in all, I found this case to be of uncharacteristically low quality for Palm, and feel the money was completely wasted.  I do see very limited use for this case, such as people who really do like to take their Palm into hazardous environments where it's likely to get banged around by heavy objects, or something of that sort.

Guess where my buttons are?  I have the Koss player with the tranparent blue lid.  Yup, buried under the snap lock and the nylon sheeth.

There's a tiny zipper pocket in it, that looks like it might hold 2 AA batteries and some keys (off the keyring) and that's about it.

Also, programming the device codes takes a bit to figure out.  I did eventually program every device (including DiSH, Panasonic DVD player, TiVo, Panasonic Stereo/Amp, Sony VCR) on any remote key I choose.  I had some initial problems until I realized it usually accepted them if I continued to depress the remote key for 4 seconds or so during programming.  Plus, this way I can activate any device without activating the VH920 Video Selector by depressing the remote key only long enough to activate the device (usually about 1 second).

A call to the hotline informed me that this Sony  model is not covered  so, as someone previously mentioned, it's best to  call before purchasing if this is important.

1872,10130,"I love these cases, and have a few of them, and will get more.  No real complaints with them - sure reduced the amount of shelf space my DVDs required, and allows me to organize by genre.  The sleeves are held in a 3-ring binder, so they can be pulled out and re-arranged, too, so if you like to keep your DVDs alphabetically, you can pop a new CD into the stream without having to move every DVD like one would have to with the stupid other caselogic cases that don't have removable pages.  The material is strong adn well made.  I very much like the leather look and feel of the case, and they look sharp on the shelf.  The zippers are strong and well formed, the rivets are good, the binder material is sturdy. These babies will last for a good long time.My only complaint with this case - and also the 10 DVD holder from caselogic - is that they really don't hold that many without bulging or overpacking. I figure the 20 DVD holder averages about 18 discs, and the 10 holder gets 8 or 9.  Figure it this way - I have 8 of these holders. One holder when I bought it was missing 5 sleeves.  But even though I started 5 sleeves less I should have, it doesn't matter, becuase after filling all the holders to their capacity, I have about 20 sleeves left over that I can't use, becuase the case holders aren't big enough to hold as many DVDs as they say.The other caveat is that they have no place in which to put a label to let you know what's inside them.  I thought of putting stickers onthem, but realized that open and closing them would eventually force the stickers to come undone, and look ugly. So what I did, and I recommend this to you, is to make small cardstock labels with the contents of the case (I sort mine by genre, so mine say \Action\ or \Science fiction\ and each genre has it's own color scheme, etc. I did not put the movie names on the labels, cuz one never knows when one will need to move a movie to another case to make room for another, eh?), and then tied some string to them and put the string through the hole in the zipper handle. This system works wonderfully, and if you make really nice cards for them, they look good, too.For those two reasons, I only give these 4 stars.Those caveats aside, these are wonderful - the sleeves have room to put the front page or other amterials from the DVD, space for the disc itself (they can even fit 2 DVDs in them, for those double DVD sets like Star Wars).  They reduced my shelving needs by about 80%, and for that, it's worth the cost,...

By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet.  For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em.

You can either tie two things to a stable, heavy object such as a big desk, or you can tie three pieces of hardware together (such as in the picture) and make it a pain in the behind for someone to take all three at once and walk out your door. Of course, none of that matters if the person knows you have the cable and brings a snazzy pair of bolt cutters.

746,10280,"January 15, 2000  3Com's Palm PDA's are definitely the best PDA's on the market. You  can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize  your life and how wonderful it is. As a Palm collector (I have all Palm  and Pilot models), I will rather compare the Palm V to the  Palm Vx. The  only difference between the two is that  the V has 2MB of RAM, while  the Vx has 8.I have thousands of addresses, thousands of appointments, and  many  more to-do items, documents, etc. in my Palm. I  also have fax, e-mail,  and internet software  installed, among many other programs. I only use  about  1.5 MB. Therefore, although I have the Vx, I don't use any of the  additional memory. Technically, because of the additional  memory, the  Vx is faster. Nonetheless, because Palm  applications are so small, this  difference is truly  negligible. Therefore, before you spend $100 more on  the Vx, make sure you're going to use the additional memory. It's the  only difference.Now, remember: the V  series is rechargable, while the III series uses  AAA  batteries. Therefore, travelling with a V palm means you'll have to  carry around the cradle. If you'd rather use batteries, maybe  the IIIx is  better for you.Good luck!",Magnificent!,1
3087,10281,"A quick take on my perception of the good and bad points of this device, and some suggestions from a vetran Palm upgrader (I've returned and repruchased these machines a little too many times!)There are a few  things I love about this device:1. You don't end up changing batteries  all the time like you did with previouis models 2. It costs lesser than the  Palm Vx 3. Synchronization with outlook 2000 is flawless 4. The screen is  very readable in bright outdoors 5. The battery lasts and lasts (they  aren't energizer bunnies!)Things I do not like about this:1. The  choice of cases for this are kind of lousy. 2. Applications built into this  device could have been a little more intuitive.Overall perceptions:1.  Good value for the money 2. Buy a spare docking cradle if you move this  between home and work PCs (accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are  in the right buying cycle) 3. Do not attempt to browse the Web on  this...you'll only be disappointed.","Excellent synchronization, good software,good bang for the $","1,3,4"
1885,10282,I got the Palm V because I'm the kinda person who gets sucked into getting something just because they're &quot;new.&quot;  This is not always the right thing to do... however.  To be sure the Palm V is a smaller version  of the Palm III.  But as far as power goes the Palm III is still the way to  go.  So if you're just a casual user of the Palm the V will give you that  wow factor... but if it's pure functionality (is that a real word?) that  you need then the III is still the better choice!,Maybe yes... Maybe no,5
3088,10283,"I am getting rid of my 16MB Windows CE device now that I have tried the Palm w/ 1/8 of the memory.  It is the easiest device to use and set-up that I have seen.  Powerful, Practical and Simple.",Fantastic Device!,1
1886,10288,"I love the great design of Palm V, this is my first palm and now I use it all the time to organize my schedule.MEMORY : Palm V provides only 2 MB of memory, which is one of the major drawbacks.  Installing all the  softwares that I needed took about 1.2MB, left me about 0.8MB for data and  stuffs. (btw there are lots of great freeware available which most I found  are better than the correspondence shareware)BATTERY PROBLEM : 3COM  advertised that one charge will last about 1 months, only true if you don't  use it regularly or  you use your cradle everyday to charge it. (it also  takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour to charge in cradle daily) One charge last  less than 2 or 3 days for me, well I almost use it most the time, organize  my schedule, expense, and playing games while waiting for my  appointment.PC ORIENTED : Palm products are also PC oriented, I use unix  systems most the time, and use my PC just to charge or synchonize with the  palm.  (it will be nice if they can provide a unix compatible cradle)  Anyway inspite of all the drawbacks, I love the Palm V, go get your own and  you will feel becoming a different person.SEVERAL ADVICES: 1. check for  available freeware b4 you buy the shareware version. 2. You will need at  least a slim leather case. (the one coming with Palm V, cause more problems  than the benefits like the never off beeping) 3. Buy Palm Vx if you have  more money. 4. If you decide to buy a Palm or its accesories, always search  the net first, don't buy at the first place you found it.  You might end up  paying 20%-50% off in other place.",great design and low of memory and battery.,1

3090,10293,"The Palm V and Vx may have seemed totally awesome, but I never fell for the hype. The Palm V and Vx have a rechargeable lithium battery. When it's day is done, there's an agonizing choice: go for a replacement one of these, have the battery replaced and risk it not working correctly, or buying something that as one user suggested could run off of easily replaceable AAA batteries. The Palm V and Vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me. If you can find that the Palm V/Vx has an acceptable set of trade offs and opportunity cost, to quote a drop dead gorgeous economics teacher I had, then it is definitely the belle of the ball. If on hand B you are practical, and want more steak and less sizzle from your handheld, the Palm VII or Palm VIIx may be a far better option.Just alerting you to something the positive reviews may gloss over.",What to do if you're into vintage computing,"2,3"
747,10298,"Where to start?  I'll begin by saying..get the Palm V...Everytime I open it up, conversations start about how organized a person I am.  Once you start relating to others about tech features, you're sure to close the  deal.  I don't know if it's the great gasp or the real deal.  I do know  this; I have been able to think less about what my day is like and smile  more knowing I have more free time due to proper planning using the Palm V.  The custom software available online and support you receive from the  company is a great combination.  If you make palm piloting a habit, you'll  sleep better at night knowing you've got everything planned ahead.  Your  only decision left to make after buying the palm organizer is which case to  buy to carry it in.  I chose the Coach leather.  Holds a check book,  business cards, credit cards and cash...enough padding to protect your  investment.

3091,10302,"Using my Palm V always makes me smile because it is about as close to perfect as any electronic device I've ever used.If anyone is on the borderline, not sure if a PDA is for them, this device will not disappoint.  It does everything that you'd want it to do, does it well, and does it  quickly.  Plus the ability to sync the Palm V with your computer's PIM  (inc. Microsoft Outlook) makes importing and exporting contacts a  breeze.If you're not sure about the Graffiti writing system, I can tell  you that it's a very easy to learn.  Five minutes worth of practicing and  you'll have it down (it's very, very close to the normal alphabet).  After  a few days you'll have it completely memorized (the Palm folks also include  a handy &quot;cheat sheet&quot; sticker that you can stick to the inside of  the cover that's included with the Palm V).As someone who bought an  Apple Newton MessagePad (and lived though that debacle) I can say from  experience that the Palm is not a product that only a geek can love.  Anyone who is busy and wants to be able to keep track of contacts and  appointments will find this device invaluable and I sincerely mean that.  Once you have one you will not want to be without it, and it sure beats  hauling a fat old paper based organizer around.Some quick notes; the  Palm V Hard Case rocks!  If you travel a lot make sure to get one.  It  keeps the Palm V completely safe from harm and looks beautiful.  Also, with  the upgrade to Palm OS 3.3, you'll be able to sync your Palm with any  laptop with an infrared port without the need for any cables.  This is  very, very cool and very useful for road warriors (one caveat here, the IR  sync does not yet work on Windows2000 based systems).Hope this helps!",An Incredible Combo of Form and Function...,"1,4"

3093,10323,"Over the last years I went from a Nokia Communicator Phone-Pda, to a Nec Mobile Pro 400 Windows CE and ultimately to a Palm V (actually Palm III  with a V upgrade). I must say the Palm isn't my favourite among the above  mentionned PDAs.On the Plus side:The interface is very pleasant to  use, it is small in size and easy to write while standing (unlike keyboard  devices), the hot sync synchronizes seemlessly with your address book,  email etc and there are many software available as well as website where  you can subscribe to channels or download information straight to the  Palm.On the minus side:Although it is  a nice device to keep diary  and track of your expenses etc., the lack of keyboard means that to enter  any long piece of text is laborious. Consequently, it you are expecting  from your Pda to be able to, say type an email or some notes while on the  road, this is the wrong device. There are many software around but if you  examine it more closely, many are not very powerful. For instance, I was  very pleased to be able to download a map from mapquest, but without the  ability to zoom or search the map it is of limited use.  Palm users are  often excited by the possibility of downloading email from the inbox. With  my previous Nokia communicator, I could download (and send) email from the  internet using my regular ISP (Unlike Palm VII which requires a proprietary  system subscription) so to download emails from my PC only fails to appear  as a very useful to me. I was also irritated by the fact that by default,  it download all emails in the inbox folder of outlook while synchronizing  which I had to delete one by one.  I know it is possible to buy a keyboard  but the keyboard being too large to be carried, I don't see the point of  that.Conclusion:If you like elegant and simple to use devices (i.e.  if you are a Mac user for instance) the Palm may be for you, especially if  you intend to use it mostly to keep your address book and diary.  If you  seek a PDA also to type notes, use interactive maps and generally expect  more than a electronic diary, I would recommend a Psion, Windows CE or the  wonderful and versatile Nokia Communicator phone.",nice interface but overated device....,"1,3,4"

3105,10447,"I read the many reviews here on this product before ordering and was somewhat concerned that so many seemed to have a problem with the software. I found the software to be easy to use although like my disc label burning software(fellows/neato), I had to experiment a little to figure out how to align pictures of the DVD covers/inserts correctly. I spent maybe 10 minutes and then began printing(I use standard paper to figure out the alignment issues as to not waste the actual covers/inserts). Some have said they would like a glossy paper option and I agree. This paper gives a somewhat dull picture quality but I still find it to be OK. If I has the option for glossy paper I would purchase that instead. I back up mostly movie DVDs and would like a more brilliant quality output. If I were backing up data DVDs, I would not have an issue with the paper quality. I have not used any other brands so I cannot, at this time, give a contrasting opinion of other products. I plan on trying other products though to see if any others do a better job for my movie DVD cover/insert needs. I will update later as I get more data on this subject. For now I'll say these covers are a good value for the money.",Does the job well,"1,3"

1912,10562,"TDK manufactures excellent six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a TDK blank VHS tape, the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover, VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand for many years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK premium quality six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape.",A great VHS casette tape !!!,1

3118,10577,"People have been saying for years that tapes would die, but fortunately, they never seem to. I know a number of people who have the car stereo that has BOTH  cd and the cassette. For that matter, I am starting to see cassette walkmans again. If you follow my reviews, you know that because of the dangers of cd rot, I prefer to make tapes of my cds and use them when possible. For those of you who don't know about cd rot, it is capable of wiping out a whole collection of cds. What happens is that heat and moisture turn the cd purple and make it unreadable. (In extreme cases, holes in the cd are prevalent.) If your cds are not so over the top, they may actually transfer well onto normal bias cassettes such as Maxell UR or TDK D. A previous reviewer pointed out that if you are making tapes of your cds to use in your car, a lot of times a normal bias cassette will suffice, since most car stereo speakers are not designed for high output. (He called the Maxell UR a perfect workhorse tape.) But moving to the high quality TDK SA tape, these tapes are superb and capable of holding the material even from high intense cds such as \Metallica's\ 'Ride the Lightning,' \Megadeth's\ 'Rust In Peace,' or \Exodus's\ 'Tempo of the Damned.' I'll conclude by saying that TDK SA will not only give you excellent travel friendly copies of your cds, but using them when you travel will keep your cds safe from cd rot.",TDK SA IS CD Rot's Arch Enemy,1

Those seem to have been fixed with subsequent  releases, and the card itself wasn't to blame.  If you do have problems,  and you can use one of the other Tulip drivers included with your OS, such  as the Digital DE500.

Overall, though, music CDs will sound quite good with this sound card and will suit the needs of most users.  All but the most intense gamers should also be happy with this card's performance.

3134,10877,"These were given as a gift.  The instruction manual is a general guide and contains no specifications particular to this binocular.The magnification of 16X is a nice idea, but too much to accommodate a steady image when using these handheld.  Without a very secure grip, it will be necessary to prop them or mount them via the threads at the front of the focus mechanism.  And as for mounting them, a center focus `wheel' would be a superior option.I find focusing to be laborious.  When I need it, the center focus doesn't have a fine enough adjustment:  Just a hair one way or the other makes things fuzzy, and this makes synchronization with the diopter adjustment a meticulous process.  However, once focus has been achieved the image is sharp and clear.The exit pupil (which is a factor of about 3---not 9[mm??] as indicated in the product description---maybe they were referring to the relative brightness) is fine for daylight viewing but low for viewing dim astronomical objects.  Better lens coating would make them brighter, but you should still be able to note the four large Jovian moons and that Saturn has rings, as well as details on the surface of the moon.Overall, and aside of the price, I give these a 2.5 rating.  For me, ease of focus is an important feature in a binocular.  The magnification you want from these will be greatly offset by the wiggly image.  I will use them mounted, but will miss the grab-and-go feature that makes a binocular appealing.  For that, a binocular of lesser magnification will always be my first choice.",Fair,"2,3"

I think MP3's are a great alternative to CD's when used ethically, and the Rio 300 is a fairly inexpensive option.  I must say that the Rio is efficient on batteries, has very good sound with very little distortion (if it's distorted, it's probably the ripper/encoder that made the MP3), and since it's completely electronic with no mechanical parts, it obviously never skips.  I run with mine and use it in the car with a cassette adapter, and I love how light it is.  Despite all these pluses, there are a few things the wary consumer should know:..As for mechanics, the Rio 300 has limited onboard memory - I get along fine with the 32 MB, but at times, especially on long trips, I wish I could play more than about 3/4 of a CD at 128bps (about &quot;CD quality&quot;).  Be ready to shell out more for that flash memory add-on.  The case on the Rio 300 is relatively fragile.  Don't count on putting it through a lot of abuse, and be careful with the belt clip, as it may strain the thin plastic - - mine cracked, but a little superglue fixed it and it's fine now.  The bottom line: if you don't have a lot of money but you want that MP3 player, it's a good buy.

And yes, the size DOES make a difference to  many people.I love getting free MP3's off the web, and while I *could*  put them on minidisks, I like being able to every day or so put a  completely different assortment of songs on the Rio to listen to. It's  certainly not much harder than recording a disk and I'm one of those people  that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition  doesn't bother ME any.Unfortunately, the Rio is not without faults.

Am  now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and  freezing up so I have to remove the battery. Oh, should mention that the  first Rio I got had a broken battery compartment and was returned. Am still  waiting on my rebates. HATE not being able to use it on Windows NT, and not  having USB. And the headsets that come with it are worthless for many  people.

800,11057,"What most of these reviewers are forgetting is that the Diamond Rio 300 was the FIRST MP3 player to hit the market.  And it was a great struggle in the courts to even get it released.I had one of these pre-ordered for  almost 3 months and finally got it 2 days after it was released.  I have  been pretty happy with the way it has held up.  I did a 16 MB upgrade for  it and it seems to hold enough music for me.It is durable, but the  button control now falls off unexpectadly.  This is probably why they moved  away from this design on the 500.Personally, I would still consider this  a very good MP3 player.  When I bought it it was over $200 and I thought  that was a bargin.

This is a review and comparison of both products.Hardware:Like the PMP300,  the PMP500 can play mp3 tracks and cd tracks, but unlike the PMP300, the  PMP500 can also play MPEG2.5, ADPCM, and Audible.com content.  The PMP500  plays Mp3s 16 to 320 Kbps and VBR.  It includes a Basic equalizer with song  adjustments such as treble, bass, etc.  The PMP300's equalizer consisted of  only four synthetic options: Normal, Rock, Classical, and Jazz.Connection:The song transfere speed from your computer to your device  for both products is relitively the same, with the PMP500 being a little  faster.  Connection from the PMP300 is made by parallel-port connection.  It is hooked into your printer port and has another parallel port in the  back for your printer so that way you can operate your printer and your  player at the same time.  The PMP500 has easy connection thru a USB socket.  NOTICE: YOU MUST HAVE A USB SOCKET IN YOUR COMPUTER TO OPERATE THE PMP500.  THE PMP500 DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS N/T OR WINDOWS 95.Buttons:The  buttons on the PMP300 are far better than the buttons on the PMP500.  The  buttons on both products are easy to use and good, but the buttons on the  PMP300 are bigger and cooler.Memory:Memory on the PMP500 is better  than the PMP300.  But keep in mind.  If you buy memory chips (They are like  disks.  There is a slot on both product for insertion.  The chips can be  easily ejected.  They are called Flash Cards.  You can buy them here.)

1953,11136,"I bought these speakers after reading nothing but positive reviews online, and listening to many different systems in the stores in my area.  After getting these things plugged in, I was really amazed - they sounded so much better than the HK's that came with my computer.  The bass was really good, tight, not really distorted.  The highs were clean, a little harsh though, and the mids were fairly good.That was about 3 months ago.  Now that I've had some time to listen to just about all the music that I own on these speakers, I have noticed a couple of things that I didn't hear before, probably because I was still in that phase of being excited about my new purchase.First of all, the sub is low-passed at 200Hz, and the tweeters are high-passed at 12KHz.  But I think the midrange drivers get the whole frequency range.  So when I play anything with a lot of low bass in it ( &lt; 80Hz or so), this really distorts the midrange because they can't reproduce those frequencies very well.  I noticed this one day when I had the sub level turned all the way down (by accident I think), and I found out why the mids were distoring.  The other thing is, the sub does not have really great low frequency extention as I would like.  For midbass ( > 40Hz or so) it is pretty good, but I really need sound in the 20-40Hz range for some movies and songs.  The frequency response of the system only goes down to 32Hz anyway, not low enough for me sometimes.Another thing, now that I think about it, was that when they did the specs for this system, they measured the wattage at a THD (total harmonic distortion) of 10%.  That is a lot of distortion, so you will probably not get 80 watts out of this system (even though it does get loud, the people in my dorm can tell you that) unless you like a lot of distortion.Now it might sound that I am unhappy with this system now, but I still really like it.  For only (...) (what I paid) it was a really good investment, but of course it is not gonna rank up with higher end stuff.  But for most of the things I use these speakers for, they are great.  Just certain things are a little lacking, but I think I can stand that for now.","Really good, but not perfect",2
812,11138,"I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80-Watt 3-Piece Subwoofer/Satellite Computer Speakers.  First and foremost, let me tell you one thing: wow, and I really mean WOW, what a great set of computer speakers!Understand: you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway.  But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today, these speakers will, out of the box, work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards.  And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.My only complaint (and it is an exeedingly *small* one) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker (volume and on/off) and the sub woofer (base volume) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit (i.e. on a satellite speaker).  But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.Net/net:1) Awesome (I would even say unsurpassed) sound quality to cost ratio2) Extremely easy set-up (took me less than 10 minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room)3) Wished the connecting wires were longer (the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer)4) Needs some industrial design tweaks (i.e. audio controls should all be in one place)5) Rich base, sweet high-ends, and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET","FOR GREAT SOUND: highly, highly, highly recommended",1

The GPX player's awesome car adapter kit is easy to use (you don't need to be an electronics whiz to use it), and it enables you to bring your music wherever you go. The bass boost system is also great. Best of all, this CD player is priced very nicely, so you can use the extra money towards a new set of headphones (The included pair is a tad flimsy).

3170,11397,"I have been using this scanner for about 3 weeks now. I own 4 other different models of scanners -- 2 from Radio Shack (PRO-92 / PRO-2067)  and 2 from Uniden (BC 245XLT and BC 235XLT).I like the BC 895XLT because:- Fast scanning of 100 channels / second. The Radio Shack (GRE made) scanners that I own only go 25 channels/second. And while they are more technically sophisticated, I miss the scan speed which is desirable if you live in a busy area.- CTCSS tone capability - What this does is let you enter in a  special &quot;code&quot; that filters out different companies using a frequency. In busy urban areas it is not unusual to have three or four businesses on the same frequency. They use a special code called a &quot;PL&quot; code which allows their radios to only hear their broadcasts. The 895xlt supports the use of the PL tone through the CTCSS tone capability built in.You might want to rethink your purchase if:- You want to follow BOTH trunked and conventional frequencies at the same time. This scanner only follows one or the other --- and if you are following trunked frequencies you'll only be able to monitor one bank of them at a time.- This scanner does not monitor a common type of trunked frequency called EDACS.Overall:I strongly recommend this scanner. Even though it has a few limitations, you cannot beat the price/performance. In reality I have found that I monitor very few trunked frequencies -- and that the bulk of my local action is the local PD and FD. Even if one town is trunked there is usually more than enough action to be heard on surrounding towns.My one exception to the above advice is if I lived in NY or another big city that had LOTS of trunking, I'd probably wait for the 780xlt model.",Fast 100 Channel / Second Scanning,"1,3,4"
1967,11399,"This scanner is Uniden's answer to key complaints about their first generation &quot;Trunk Tracker&quot; scanners.  The BC-245XLT will now track multiple trunked radio systems simultaneously, it will scan  conventional and trunked systems simultaneously, and it will now track  EDACS (TM) trunked radio systems.Other new features include computer  interface port, &quot;Smart Scanner&quot; programmability via telephone  modem (a feature requiring a 900-number call at $0.99/min.), and cloning  capability.Otherwise, this radio is similar in operation and  functionality to its predecessor, the BC-235XLT.  It features 300 channels,  12 band coverage from 29-956 MHz (excluding cellular and 512-806MHz),  Service Search, attenuator, automatic display lighting, and other unique  features.On the downside, the radio delays for 5 seconds between  scanning trunk systems even if no signals are detected.Overall, this  is a great radio for the money.  It is the best available technology for  scanning enthusiasts who want to monitor the modern trunked radio systems  in use by numerous public service agencies worldwide.","Newest Technology, Many Improvements",1
3171,11400,"I recently purchased a Uniden BC 245XLT handheld scanner and am generally very pleased with it. It is well designed, well made, easy to program manually, and has good sound quality. My only complaint so far is my  inablity to use its new, highly touted &quot;Smartscanner&quot; feature to  download frequencies from the Uniden/Bearcat national frequency database  via a PC or external modem. To access the database via a PC, it is  necessary to go to Uniden's Website, download a small program (that is  zipped but not self-unzipping), install the program and, while it's  running, dial a 900 phone number that's preprogrammed into the scanner.  Unfortunately, it took me many frustrating and unsuccessful attempts to  connect with the 900-number database using both my PC and, separately, an  external modem before I discovered that my phone company, GTE  Communications Corporation, routinely and automatically blocks 900 numbers  from being dialed and that there is no way of getting around the block.  While the scanner's operating guide mentions the possibility of a 900 block  on one's phone line, since I had never requested such a block from the  phone company, it had never occurred to me that there would be one as a  matter of GTE policy. Thus, before buying a BC 245XLT with the hope of  using the Smartscanner feature, a person should check with his/her phone  company to make sure that 900-number calls can be made. If 900-number  blocking is fairly common among phone companies, I think Uniden should  switch to a non-900 number for frequency downloading. Or, if they maintain  their policy of charging for downloads, they should consider making them  available over the Internet through the use of a credit card and a secure  server.Would-be purchasers of the BC 245XLT should also be aware that  Uniden's 800 Customer Service number, once one is able to get through, may  be answered by someone who doesn't know much about the Smartscanner feature  of the product. The first time I called and told the Customer Service  representative that I was getting an &quot;error&quot; message on the  scanner screen when I tried to dial the 900-number frequency database, I  was told that that was because their server would not be operational for  another couple of days. When I tried a couple of days later and still got  an error message, another customer rep demanded to know, &quot;Who told you  that about our server?&quot; but did give me some useful information about  COM port settings in the software I had downloaded previously from the  Uniden Website. On my next attempt and next error message on the scanner, a  third and different customer rep told me that, after seeing the 1 900-  prefix on my scanner screen, I would need to manually punch in the rest of  the telephone number on the scanner keypad to be able to make the call. It  was only when that didn't work that I called my phone company and  discovered that there was a 900 block on my phone line. As a last resort, I  called Uniden again and asked if there was any way, other than using the  900 number, to download frequencies. She told me she would have to ask her  supervisor and, a couple of minutes later, gave me another 800 number to  call. When I called that number, which I think was the Bearcat Radio Club,  and told the person who answered about my Smartscanner problem, she  replied, &quot;I don't know nothing (sic) about that.&quot; As is often  necessary these days, I then asked, &quot;Is there someone there who  does?&quot; A fairly knowledgeable-sounding person then came on the line  and suggested that some purchasable third party software might do the  trick. I haven't tried this yet but, in these matters, hope springs  eternal, I guess.",Great Scanner Except for Frequency Download,"1,3,4"

It works pretty well, but the mic is real quiet right out of the box, but after turning the volume all the way up and putting the microphone boost up to 10dB, it is super clear and crisp. If you put the mic boost up to 20dB you can hear large amounts of feedback (buzzing/humming noise), but that it not too big of a problem, because it works fine with a 10dB boost. I would recommend this to any gamer, but if you can spend a little more money, go for the ANT Lion Mod Mic V2.EDIT 10/8/13: I recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable, and has a volume control and mute button, and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback (buzzing/humming noise).",Pretty good for gaming,"1,3,4"

However, whenever I activate the software for the camera, the Zip drive and floopy drive - both connected to the USB hub - shut down.  This may be a potential drawback, especially for those for whom directly-connecting the camera is not an option due to the need for other peripherals.Interestingly, I also have MyVideo (USB video capture/outout device) connected to my iMac.  Whenever I open the MyVideo software for video capturing, the image from the QuickCam VC shows up in the MyVideo window!  This almost certainly means that both devices are using the same set of system calls or video drivers.

3175,11449,"I have two of these, one I just bought (used-mint condition) and one I bought new several years ago which is now dead.  People who do computer-aided design and need fine cursor control absolutely love the FX because the large ball gives you just that - better fine control than any other mouse or trackball.  However, some actions, like drag and drop, are difficult to do with the traditional left button and ball, and instead require the use of the 3rd button as a drag lock, which is easy to do, but different than you may be used to -- once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  The fourth button can be programmed for scrolling.  The buttons are programmable - you can choose what function you want them to perform.The hand placement over the curvaceous FX body is also very comfortable and even relaxing - once you get used to it, and don't try to drag and drop with the left button and ball.  You can use both your thumb and one or even two or three fingers to move the ball around without ever tiring or straining.The downside of this model is that Logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit, and no parts are available for repairs, and no one I know repairs them.  To get a part, you must cannibalize another Trackman Marble FX, and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span -- assuming you can get a used one with still usable components.  There are no new FX's anywhere.Another downside is that the FX only came with either a serial port or a PS/2 connector.  There are no USB or wireless versions.  And every attempt to utilize a USB adapter results in some functionality being lost.  The serial port has long gone the way of the Dodo bird, and PS/2 ports are non-existent on new model computers.  In another 5 years the FX will be largely obsolete and incompatible.  This has already affected the going price.  Whereas a couple of years ago, even a poor-condition FX commanded a steep price, a mint-condition FX now command less than $100 (I won my minty for only $82 just yesterday as I write this). Yes, there are vendors still listing FX's near $300, but they aren't getting many takers, if any.The bottom line for this once very superior design is that apart from a few fanatics (like myself) who have yet to upgrade to a new USB-only PC (or Mac) the FX is dated, and soon will be obsolete and incompatible with the new equipment coming out.",Once superior design now dated and headed for obselesence,"1,3"

The downside with this (and any trackball or mouse) is that dust accumulates inside the housing but this is super easy to clean when it does.

People tend to find another computer with a regular mouse rather than &quot;borrowing&quot; mine when they need to &quot;just check my e-mail real quick.&quot;All my other trackballs would have to be taken apart on a regular basis to clean the little foam guides inside, but I have had my Marble F/X for over a year now and it is basically maintenance free.

3177,11470,"I have had three of these now in around 15 years.  Yes I said 15 years, or at least since they first came out.  They are the best trackball that was ever made,ever made.  They fit your hand like no other trackball out there including any that Logitech has made since.  I really hope that Logitech will make them again, because you can't beat them.  They are so expensive now that most of the time you can't find one that you can afford.  The few that are out there that are new are being sold for close to $500.  That is just unheard of.  Of course those doing that probably won't sell it or maybe they might.  Used ones are usually REALLY USED and the buttons will go out sooner or later.  But if you can find one that has the Logitech logo intact on the top and hasn't been rubbed off, then it wasn't used much because that is the first thing to go and it doesn't take long for that to go, maybe about a year or less of use. The one I have just purchased, the logo is sharp and so I know that it hasn't been used much. Even this one wasn't cheap, but it was cheap enough that I was willing to foot the bill for it because you can't beat this trackball.",Great Trackball,"1,4"
3178,11472,I've had this trackball for over three years now. It is brilliant for right or left hand users. I actually prefer to use it left handed! The left click button is right in line with my middle finger and the large portion of the ball is just right for my thumb to control all of the scrolling. Right click maneuvers are a bit of a trick to figure out but it's very doable. The nice thing about the trackball is that you can flick the ball and you are at the other side of the screen in no time.This style track ball along with an ergonomic keyboard are great to deter co-workers who like to hop on your computer to check their email or what-not.,Lefties can use it!,1

Infact, I'm typing this review with it.  It's &quot;quiet, tactile&quot; key action is quite true; this is the  quietest keyboard I've ever used. Very good at not waking anobody next  door, while keeping its nice responsiveness. (This isn't one of those quiet  keyboards where the keys kind of sink and don't have that distinct typing  noise, this one is just, well, &quot;perfect&quot;) The font on the keys  are more attractive than other fonts, just my opinion, and the palm rest is  indeed very comfortable. Very elegant design too. I don't know if it's  &quot;really&quot; spill proof yet because to tell the truth, I've never  really spilled anything on it. Well, guess I'm overobsessing.

839,11499,"This is the first real camera I've ever bought and I'm glad I made the investment. When shopping around for a camera, I was looking for a few main things. It had to be:1. Easy to use2. Portable, not a hassle to lug around3. in my price range (under $70)This camera is ,of course all three. I didn't know about APS cameras before i bought this camera. I've seen my mom struggle trying to put film in her 35mm and that made me want to stick with disposables and it also made me apprehensive about buying a camera. Then i found out about APS and it I was like Hallelujah! It was a godsend for a klutz like me. Just drop the film in and the camera does the rest.When I first saw this camera, i couldn't believe there was a camera this small. It literally fits in the palm of my hand. I'm a big girl but it'll seem small to you too. I carry it in my purse because you never know when you'll need a picture. It hardly weighs anything so it's not a burden. It's small enough for jacket or shirt pockets.Because this was going to be my first camera and all, I wanted to get something that was reasonably priced yet didn't lack in quality. Canon being a respected brand, this was an easy choice.I have no regrets so far with this camera and i doubt I'll have any in the future. My pictures turn out great and i like the date/time imprint feature (on the back of photo). Although the Elph LT has no zoom it takes pretty good pictures.

876,11838,"I have two. I made one into a clean tissue dispenser by filling a plastic round canister with tissues from a cardboard tissue box, and slipping the plastic canister into the Case Logic bag. It is a bit of effort to refill, and then I discovered that the Kleenex Oval Expressions box fits perfectly though quite snugly. The CaseLogic bag is longer, and the Kleenex box would slip down to the bottom (away from the opening at the top), so I use a clip to roll the bottom of the CaseLogic bag up to keep the tissues at the top opening of the bag.My only complaint about the bag is about the velcro. The bag comes with a strip of velcro attached to one side, and another strip with a removable glue back that you can stick somewhere in the car to keep the bag from swinging around. I strongly dislike hook-and-loop because it catches on fine materials. The strip of velcro that is on the bag itself is the side that snags everything, so I have to keep the other matching side of velcro stuck on it.

I like the auto-closing opening so if it does go flying through the car somehow the trash stays inside. The only thing I didn't like was that while I'm driving sometimes its hard to get a larger item into the bag with only one hand. (Because of the elastic that keeps it closed) But perhaps I shouldn't be doing that while driving anyway...Emptying the bag is a breeze! Just undo the velcro and shake over a trash can, fold it back up and velcro again. The velcro is very solid and I don't forsee anything falling out of the bottom at all.

The Sony sw7600gr and the Sangean ATS909 are much better buys . Here's why , first off the Grundig YB400pe is generally not made very well . The poor quality of the body , the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen . The tuner sensativity on FM is good but AM and SW are fair . The side band set up is ok , others are better . One draw back is that it takes 6 AA batteries while the others take 4 .This makes the radio very heavy for its size . True that the Sangean 909 and the Sony 7600 are a little more expensive but worth it . You are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound . So I guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good.",Average performance radio,2
879,11900,"This is an absurd piece of junk. If you intend to limit its use to light local AM and FM broadcasts or pretending you're Flash Gordon it may  suffice, as long as you have a home palatial enough to accomodate it.  However, even with a decent long wire shortwave antenna you will need  either a lot of patience or very strong stations, because tuning the clumsy  slide-style tuner is almost impossible to do with any degree of precision.  Even in an area of good radio reception this unit requires a quality  antenna for any, including the strongest, stations, especially on FM.  You  will need -- and this is not a myabe, you will will will need -- separate  antennas for FM and AM, and don't underestimate the headache this may  represent for you, not to mention the extra expense and rat's nest of wires  needed just to bring static down to acceptable levels. And you won't get  away with just a cheap FM dipole antenna: the one I tried did nothing for  this gigantic colossus, and I had to use a powered FM antenna. (I had to  try three until I finally tuned out the static on FM). The feel is mushy,  and in fact, the knobs aren't even firmly set in place -- whatever it is  that they're are attached to moves around as you rotate the knobs, as if  they didn't finish putting the thing together inside the case. It surprised  me how shabbily made this fairly cool-looking radio was when I first  started messing around with it. There are two things about this radio that  are unforgivable: NO HEADPHONE JACKS! Even as I write this I can't quite  believe it, and feel like one will appear, it will have been cleverly  hidden -- but no matter how hard I look, how much credit I give them for  ingeniously disguising the thing -- it's not there. So if you're going to  use this bedside, just remember that it will always be a group activity,  and using it to record anything is ruled out for you. This is absolutely  beyond belief, considering that a jack would have added about four cents to  the cost  of  this behemoth. Equally irritating is that the line input for  using an auxiliary sound source -- your cd walkman, say -- is absolutely  terrible. You need to turn the unit way up just to hear what you've  attached, and then it comes through sounding like a damp toilet paper and  comb kazoo. I don't know how they could have possibly failed to do this  properly, but please do not buy this device if you expect to listen to your  cd player through it. The sound will kill you. The wooden case is nicely  made, but beware, it is much bigger than you might expect, about the size  of a medium-size microwave oven, and it needs even more space than its  footprint alone would suggest, because two of the three speakers are on the  side. Bottom line -- if you really like the way it looks and you don't mind  static on most stations, if you never intend to listen to an auxilliary  player through it, if its use as a shortwave is limited to maybe BBC and  other big-output stations, AND if you both never want to use headphones or  record anything, then this might, just might, do the job. Or you could get  a real radio nd use something else for decoration.","Good Looking, Bad Engineering",2

I ordered the 960 from barbjewels through Amazon.  I received it promptly, packaged well and in perfect condition.  I suspect that it is the first version because it has the side speakers (my suspicion is based on other reviews).  First, irrespective of performance, it IS a great conversation piece.  But, it also has terrific sound and reception qualities - - kind of that old time sound that I want to believe I remember.  I began listening to a local oldies station on FM using an internal plug-in antenna.  Perfect.  I have since plugged my XM into the auxillary jack.  Again, perfect.

Even when attaching, instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection.Since the tech instructions, tell you to keep them down to under 350 feet, these cables, whether they are long or short, are in the right lengths.I know Amazon doesn't print prices in their reviews, but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down. The 50 foot roll was half again as much locally.These are the Category 5e cables. They give you a better return feed, which results in better overall performance. So insist on 5e instead of just 5. I initially bought some wall plates from (a nation wide electrical supply store) that were Category 3, then I returned those for the snap in option Category 5. Those were returned also, when I went to (a nation wide building supply center)... (of all places to go networking) and they had the complete Leviton line of 5e accessories.If I had to do it over again, I would still buy the Belkin 50 footers. I don't want to have a 500 foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around.These are tops. Gold plated connectors, Snag free ends, that protect that little lock in tab on the ends. You know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire, out of a wiring mess, and the little tab bends over backwards, never to work properly again.

2025,12351,"For professional typists, a natural keyboard is vital. Its key point is the possibility for hands to rest on the keyboard in their natural position, without need to curve one's wrists. One can then let his hands  constantly in a ready position to type in a command, effortlessly. From  this point of view, the size of the keys or their relative positions  doesn't really matter. One eventually get used to it, and if you ask me, I  like the feeling of this keyboard more than any other that I know. With it,  my speed reach 122 words per minute. Any other keyboard reminds me  constantly of its existence. This one is almost part of me.Using it for  UNIX doesn't spoil its capabilities. For instance, one of the window-keys I  use as a shortcut for M-x under Emacs, and the Ctrl key position is so well  fitting the hand's side that one has just to gently bend it to push the  key, without any strain on fingers. Ctrl-a or Ctrl-e which require the same  hand then go as one key. And what a more important key than the Ctrl one  for UNIX people?",The good stuff from Microsoft,1
2026,12361,"This keyboard has fantastic feel to it. I did talk to many people who say that they just cannot get used to it. I am used to it and enjoying it after 5 minutes of use. I don't feel pain in my wrists anymore which is the big plus. However, this keyboard does have couple of immense mistakes in it's design of arrow keys and shortcuts such as &quot;home&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, etc. Arrow keys are not alligned in a usual way, they are much more compact as well as shortcut keys which is, for me, A BIG problem. For half an inch of space, this keyboard did lose a lot of points. Also, the keyboard is very high, which means that if you have a desk where the base slides, you are in truble. In all, this product does have an excellent feel as far as typing goes, however, there are many more flaws to it. Honstly I would rather buy Professional version of this keyboard, and pay more monay for it. That is why I give this product grade of three stars minus.","great feel, problem with arrow and shortcut keys.",3
912,12362,"The arrow keys take a little getting used to, but it is great on the wrists.When I first started using this keyboard it was on my computer at work.  For about the first 3 or 4 days, I had trouble with the arrow keys, and the 6 keys above the arrows (home, end, delete, page up, page down, and  insert).  The problem is that they are arranged different than any keyboard  that I have used before.  Once I was used to using this keyboard, I had a  difficult time using my keyboard at home.  Shortly thereafter I replaced my  home keyboard with this one.As far as key placement goes, the important  things to know are:1.  The placement of the backslash key.  I have seen  this in a couple different places on different keybards.  The Microsoft  Natural Keyboard Elite V2.0 has the backslash key above the enter key and  below the backspace key.  This allows for the larger backspace key.  I feel  that this is very important, since this is something that I have become  very used to.  Over the last 15 years, I have tried keyboards that have the  backslash key next the the backspace key, and I just seem to make mistakes  with that placement.  Microsoft has done this one correctly (in my humble  opinion).2. The keypad above the arrows (home, end, delete, page up,  page down, and insert) is arranged different that I have ever seen it done  before.  Usually this is a keypad that is 3 keys wide by 2 tall, Microsoft  has changed the layout to 3 tall by 2 wide.  This doesn't seem to perform  any differently than the old way, it is just different (not good or bad,  just different).  This will take a little getting used to, but it works  well once you have adapted.3.  The arrow keys.  Until this keyboard, I  have always seen the arrangement of 3 arrow keys across the bottom (left,  down, right), with one centered above those 3 (up).  This does it  differently, there are 2 keys in the middle area (left and right) with a  key centered above (up), and below (down).I seem to be able to type  faster using this keyboard than I have using other keyboards.I used the  original Microsoft natural keyboard, and it is elevated off the desk much  higher.  The older one had an option to raise the front of the keyboard,  but this one only has the option to rais the back.The lights for scroll  lock, num lock, and caps lock are located in the center of the keyboard, in  the break between the left and the right hand side of the home row.  This  is good because they are easier to notice than when the lights are in the  keys or next above the number lock.I use this keyboard on both windows  and unix, and it works great.I am not someone who has had problems  with my wrists, but I do notice that it is just more comfortable.If you  spend much time at they keyboard, I would recommend this keyboard.","A great keyboard, but it takes a little getting used to.","1,3"

This took me about two days to get used to and now I am able to type on  both my keyboard and regular keyboards without any problems.

2029,12399,"I paid a few extra bucks for a &quot;scroll mouse&quot; when I bought this PC about a year ago (millenium present).  I'd never used one, but thought it had to be better than the regular kind of mouse.  Anyway, I expected some generic rodent, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a genuine Microsoft IntelliMouse when I unpacked the boxes.  Now I find I was doubly lucky, because my mouse was made in China (it seems the Mexican model is not a winner).The IntelliMouse is contoured for your hand, assuming you are righthanded.  This seems a bit elitist since in my role as a computer trainer, I've come across plenty of righthanded people who prefer to &quot;mouse&quot; with their left hand.  But since I'm completely righthanded, that doesn't present any problems for me.  I find that it's well-balanced, and has a very &quot;positive&quot; feel in my hand - any lighter would be flimsey and heavier would wear out my hand/arm.  The wheel moves smoothly when it's gently &quot;tickled&quot; along, and I've never had it jump too far when used in this way.  However, if you press the wheel down, it goes into (an intially daunting) fast scroll mode, where you can move through the page just by moving the mouse.  It takes a little practice, but makes browsing long documents/webpages a cinch.When I requested an IntelliMouse at work, since I am the lucky person elected to convert all our documentation to HTML, typically they went for overkill and got me an IntelliMouse Optical.  Now, that is a whole handful of mouse!  My glove size is &quot;large&quot; (female), but my hand seems to be at full stretch all the time, and due to Microsoft's effort to make it suitable for left and righthanded people, my hand is at a slightly uncomfortable angle.  Plus, I have to explain the red light to the passers-by who seem to be attacted to it like moths to a flame (they currently have regular wheel-less mice).  I have no trouble switching back to my comfortable &quot;home&quot; mouse.I've thought about getting an optical mouse at home, but I think I'd only be paying big bucks for a red light.  It might be different if my home was PC a laptop, or if I used the Internet more (I mainly play games). I rarely have to clean my IntelliMouse (I don't eat at my computer ... much) and my desk has a retractable keyboard/mouse shelf, which probably helps with the dust problem (so much dust, so little desire for housework).  I've been known to curse loudly when I loose my cursor while playing Baldur's Gate 2, but those are the only times I am not completely happy with this little rodent.","As much mouse as most people need, unless you like RED!",1
917,12400,"When I used my mom's computer before I went to college, I became very attached to this mouse. Now that I have a computer of my own, I couldn't stand the cheap two-button one one that came with it. Now that I have this, I'm back to that feeling again.Unlike the newer optical models, you have to clean the mouse often so it won't junk up with dirt build up. This occured many times with my older one, so I would expect to have the same exact problem with this one. Also, this mouse has a smooth plastic feeling, not rubbery. It can be a little hard for the hand.Other than that, it's a decent cheap model.",Ergonomic feel is something you get used to,1

If you are suffering  from pains in your hand and are looking for a great solution than this  mouse is for you!",THE GREATEST MOUSE EVER INVENTED,1
918,12408,"Relative to other trackballs, this one is lacking in overall features, but it does have the basics and a wheel. In addition, it is aestheticly disapointing. However, I have tried Logitech and Kensington, and both those brands always give my system problems with vavious driver conflicts and other things. I have never been able to get Logitech devices to work on my system, and Kensington devices always caused routine errors.  Thus, I went with this trackball and have operated trouble free ever since. I gave this device 4 stars because of it reliability, but I hope MS does a redesign soon.",Most reliable,1

The claims of this mouse getting dirty are correct, however, I have found several ways of fixing it. The first thing I do is to use a Q-Tip cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol and clean the rollers. The isopropyl alcohol will dissolve the dirt that gets in the mouse. The second thing I do is to rub the rollers inside with sandpaper. The rollers have a tendency to get smooth and that combined with the smoothness of the trackball makes this mouse prone to being affected by dirt. The sandpaper solution is very effective.",How to fix the dirt problem.,5

The replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one. It doesnt fit right.

Why this is, i have no clue but it's really annoying.For anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit, otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silo.Personally though i dont use the stylus. I recommend you go get one of those multi-pens that have a stylus, pen and pencil all in one. All serious Palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps, at the very least. Its like writing with a toothpick. If you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen. Cross makes a good one, Lamy and Rotring also makes excellent multipens.

After I went through the simple installation process when I got home, I popped in the game that wouldn't previously work, but sure enough, it worked, and it worked great.  Then I performed a little test.  I put in the game NHL 99 which I played a lot with my old card and tryed it with my Voodoo.  I could not believe what I saw.  The players were infinitely sharper, their reflections now appeared crystal clear on the ice as opposed to cheesy shadows before, the detail of the arena could have been confused with a real life image of an arena, and my hockey players moved as if they had suddenly come to life.  It was all as if this was a real hockey game and minurature players where being payed to live and play in my computer.  I then put in game after game that I had played before and each time I grew even more satisfied that I had chosen the Voodoo 3 3000.  If you are looking for a good price, easy installation, and superior graphics, look no further than the 3DFX Voodoo.",HOLY SCHNIKEYS!!!,1

As I agree with most of what is said, I also would like to point out that Glide is not... that's &quot;not&quot;... on its way out. Please, the fact that it is only supported by one chipset? And how  many video cards run this chipset? Yah, tha's what I thought :)Anyways,  yes, the GeForce does outperform a Voodoo 3 card. It also costs $100 or  more over a voodoo 3 card. But, the Voodoo 3 card outperforms the GeForce  cards in OpenGl. Period. Check all the reviews :) This card is for me, and  will be a happy addition to my puter's case.Please take note on the  user's review commenting on the likeness of Voodoo3 to SoundBlaster.

This was the best video card on the market at the time I bought it back in 1999/2000 and this thing rocked.  I played need for speed, doom, ect...with this beast with flawless graphic details.  Plus, I had radio and TV with my cable connected to the system for internet.  Granted now, it looks small (16mb on board), and slow (clocked at 183mhz), but this did it all.

2046,12661,"I have had this card for over 6 months now and looking back wish I had nveer bought it. I am from the train of thought of measuring performace with the human eye, and functionality with ease of use and productivity. So  there are 2 elements to this card: The 3d and the TV. The 3d is the better  aspect to this card. excellant driver support but not noticeabily better  then the voodoo2 (or SLI). This seems a very intermiedate card released  while knowing that there was better to come. The 32bit color is also a  myth. Your human eye wont notice the difference!  So the 3d is good - not  as mesmorising as the Voodoo2 first was. The TV  element has to be one of  the worst peices of hardward/software I have ever seen (and I bought this  card for video edit - DOH!). True 3dfx have to release a product that is  compatable on many different systems in many countries but Hauuppage have  managed it. The drivers for the TV are appalling. Update after update fixes  dont work - just check the website - and old problems come back etc. Sound  card compatability problems and viewing full screen problems , the list  goes on, its simply not worth the hassle - I can gaurantee some kind of  problem.  The software for capture simplly doesn;t work - I have to use MGI  Videowave. The capture is NOT as good a 40 Hauppage card, and the  compression on MPEG1 is not as good. True you get real time compression but  the quality and file size is worse. And this is with a 72000RPM hard drive.  Anything slower dont evern bother.  I think I'll fork out 40 and buy my  old Hauppage card again as this is a steel for video capture and think  twice before buying a 3dfx card again. Be warned",A vey badly released product,"2,3"

2056,12850,"if you have a chance to buy two buy them, I don't know how long the camera its going to be available but what I like about it, it takes better pictures than my Cannon EOS, the first thing I noticed are the deep colors it brings you specially the bright ones, then with confidence you can take as much as you like shots in any kind of conditions with the piece of mind knowing the camera will provide you with the best condition for that moment, trust me.I couldn't believe that from that lens my camera has, can produce so wonderful pictures, and that is what practically what I want. I do take also a lot of digital pictures but with this camera it makes me want to spend time taking with 35mm films.",Please buy Two instead,1
3274,12853,"I bought the HTsi+, Minolta 28-80 and 70-210 and the 5400HS flash. It is a wonderful combination. The camera is the perfect combination of sophistication and simplicity. I have not yet had a bad photo or incorrect  exposure. If all you want is a &quot;point and shoot&quot;, it'll do that.  If you want absolute control of the camera, you can do that. In between are  enough modes and settings to keep a very advanced amateur satisfied. The  flash is amazing. It has a guide number of 152. It follows every movement  of the lens, zooming instantly. It can also be used off the camera and is  triggered by the HTsi's built-in fill flash.  I was a little worried about  the heavy use of plastics in the camera. I have pleasantly surprised -  plastics have come a long way. I do not hesitate to recommend this camera.",None better at this price,"1,4"
3275,12859,"The Olympus D-340R is, in my opinion, the best value digital camera available right now.The picture quality is impressive---I usually can't tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a $340 SLR that I have scanned in.Also, the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use, like a good point and shoot camera  should be.Since I bought my Olympus, I have not taken 1 non-digital  photograph.  I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs (some $10/roll).Overall, the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photography.",Top Notch Digital Photography for a Bargain Price,"1,4"
2057,12862,"My D-340R stopped working after one day. The &quot;condition indicator LED&quot; started blinking and never stopped (the camera won't work when it's blinking) (No, the problem wasn't with the battery or smartmedia  card.) Olympus online tech help is worthless - automated response only.  When I called their tech support, I was told to return it to the retailer.  This is a COMMON problem and is a main reason the price of this camera is  falling. Luckily Amazon.com was very helpful in getting my money back.",Stopped working after 1 day,3
3276,12870,I just bought this camera based on the reviews here. I cant add much to the reviews above (The image quality and features on this thing are top notch) but I did want to let prospective buyers know that Olympus is now  offering the camera with 4 NiMH batteries and a quick charger included.  Nice to know the company takes consumer feedback seriously!,Still improving a great product,1
3277,12871,"I posted a review of this camera a few weeks ago, shortly after purchasing it.  I gave it 4 stars, mainly because the manual wasn't well written.  However, that still being the case, I must say that this camera deserves 5 stars!  It takes amazingly clear, bright pictures.  The video display LCD  is bright.  And it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to  run down! I highly recommend this camera!  If it had an optical zoom, it  would be perfect.  However, with this camera, you get more than you pay for!",I'm upgrading my rating,"1,4"
2058,12873,"If it had an optical zoom lens, this camera would be perfect! But, it would also cost a lot more. The  camera is nice and small, fits easily in a coat pocket so you can take it  anywhere. Picture quality is great, a bit soft on landscapes but all  digital cameras are, even the 2 megapixel ones don't really do landscapes  that well. The macro shots from this camera look spectacular, and people  shots are just great. They print out very nicely, too. The autofocus works  very well, and the metering is excellent (you can adjust the exposure up  and down 1 stop if you want, but so far I haven't found it necessary).  Color saturation is great, and very accurate. You can't adjust the white  balance manually, but fortunately the camera's automatic white balancing  works extremely well. You have 4 options when taking pictures, SQ (standard  quality), HQ (high quality), SHQ (super high quality) and SHQ uncompressed.  SQ is 640x480, the rest are 1260x980, the only difference being the  compression used. HQ uses the most compression, and SHQ uncompressed uses  no compression at all (a nice feature that many cameras don't have -for  those really detailed shots). I find HQ works just fine for most pictures,  and I can get 73 of those on a 16MB card. The viewfinder is a bit small,  but not hard to find, and it's quite clear. The LCD is good, even in the  daylight. Controls are easy to learn and well laid out. It's easy to view  your pictures on the LCD, and you can delete any one (or all of them) at  the touch of a button. You can also protect any of them from being  accidentally erased. There's a 3x feature that allows you to see a portion  of the picture a 3 times the size, useful for determining how sharp it  really is, or if you moved the cameral during the shot. The flash works  very well for its size, and you can easily turn it off, set it for fill, or  red-eye reduction. The panorama mode works great, even hand-held. I took  some shots of a church with the steeple way, way up there, using the  panorama feature, and when I assembled the shots later on the computer  (it's an automatic process) the result was tremedous. You could not see the  seams at all, even though I took the shots hand-held. Great stuff. The  camera is pretty sturdy too. I dropped it from about 3 feet and  (thankfully) it survived. The software is reasonably good, and I really  like the little Camedia thumbnail viewer. Downloading from the camera is  smooth, although a bit slow since it's serial. However, the FlashPath  adapter works really nicely and is much, much faster. The camera uses batteries pretty quickly,  but if you get some NIMH rechargeables you'll have no worries. Go to Thomas  Distributors on the web, and buy the MAHA MHC-C204F charger  and  8 NIMH batteries and you'll never run out. With the MAHA you can even recharge them in your car. Don't buy the Olympus NIMH charger, it only works with Olympus batteries (yes I tried it with some others and it  got so hot it almost caught fire) and doesn't have the features of the MAHA  (and it costs quite a bit more).  By the way, the camera comes with a  home version of PhotoDeluxe, which is an OK photo editor. Has the basics.  But you'll probably want something else eventually. I recommend PhotoSuite  II - really great for the price and very easy to use.  Anyway, I guess  I've rambled a bit, but bottom line I'm very happy with this camera. Going  digital is so freeing - you can take as many shots as you want, no film  costs, see exactly what you have before you walk away, and then put it all  into your computer to play with.","Truly a great little camera, especially for the price","1,4"
958,12882,"After doing a lot of searching on line I decided to order this camera.Thanks to Amazon's always excellent service the camera arrived just in time for a family trip I had planned.This left me with only a few hours  to learn what to do before using the camera for the first time. Though the  manual has 183 pages it takes about 3 minutes to learn how to do the  basics. Truly impressive. I went on my merry way and shot a whole bunch of  pictures. Upon returning home I installed the included software and  downloaded the pictures. One gripe regarding the software package;it would  be nice to have a &quot;Lite&quot; version of the instructions for use for  us novices. I'm sure the help section has an answer to every question, but  all I want to do is the basics and this software has so many features it  gets to be a pain to find answers. I did get it working tho, and am truly  impressed with the quality of the pictures I took. I did not get the power  converter, but am planning to use rechargable batteries so the drain during  downloading is no issue. All in all I find this camera a pleasure to use  for a first time user like me, and I'm sure if you bother to find out all  the features for just about anyone. All in all a great product!",From a novice,1
2059,12889,"I purchased the Olympus 340-R in the summer of '99 for around $350. So far it has proven to be nothing less than spectacular. The image quality is excellent. Most of my pictures are of friends and families indoors, at  bars, or sometimes outside. Download time seems to be pretty quick. I  purchased Ni-MH rechargable batteries and the battery life has been  excellent. Perhaps the only feature I wished I had was a ZOOM. But for an  entry level camera this one is hard to beat.",Great Entry Level Digital Camera,"1,4"
959,12900,"This is my first digital camera and my very first camera forover $200. Overall, I'm happy with it - it's easy to carry andtakes great pictures.  There's not a pause between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture, which is a problem with other digital cameras.  Some things to keep in mind though:1. Downloading from the camera to your computer is EXTREMELY slow through the Serial Cable.  Buy the SMART DISK floppy. Basically, your memory card fits right into the floppy disk, and the floppy disk works just like any floppy.  The only bad thing about the floppy is it takes two lithium batteries.2. If you have a laptop, you probably want to buy the DDSMFLSAD Smart Media Adapter for PCMCIA slot. Does the same thing as the SMART DISK floppy, but obviously cheaper. Same downloading speed.3. If you don't buy 1 or 2, then buy an AC adapter (which by the way, doesn't come with the camera). Your camera must be on to transfer the pictures to your computer. Again, extremely SLOW.4. There isn't a protective covering for the LCD monitor, so buy a camera case. This case doesn't come with the camera. Costs around $20 at any store. Actually you can buy the Olympus 200-523 Accessory Kit which has the AC Adapter, 2 MB card, and camera case.5.  This camera comes with an 8 MB card which holds 36 HQ pictures or 18 SHQ pictures. I can't tell the difference between the two qualities.  8 MB is good enough. After taking about two days worth of pictures, I download them to my computer and erase the 8 MB card. I don't feel the need to have more or larger cards. But then again, if I traveled and didn't have access to my PC, then I would invest in a couple 32 MB card.6. Camera doesn't have zoom. I took some pictures of my friends running a marathon, and it would've been great to have the zoom feature. I sometimes regret not buying the Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera for $600.  If you like taking close-up pictures without being near the object, then don't buy this camera.So in summary, I actually spent an extra $200 bucks ($500 total) to make this purchase worthwhile.","good camera, but it costs more than you think...",1
960,12905,I just bought this CD to try it out and i must say it has very good quality audio and it stores my data with no problem at all.

3278,12907,"Sure, it has great optics.  And you can't beat a SLR camera for composition.  The smartmedia interfaces [pcmcia or usb] are blazingly fast.  Ample resolution to print a 4x6 photo.Think of it as the digital  equivalent to a Polaroid camera.  Instant review of your shots [essential  at events such as reunions!] and enough features to keep you interested  until it comes time to get the next great thing.As with any other  piece of technology, I expect it to be rugged -- it is.  The zoom is WITHIN  the camera, not outside, so you can't hurt its gears by dropping it.

961,12910,"Pick this camera up and you'll be reminded of the heft of older, metal-bodied 35mm film cameras. It seems that the SLR setup has added a significant weight burden, while supposedly lending better optics to the camera. In this price range, most digital cameras now offer potent optical zoom lenses (7-10x not uncommon), while the 620 makes do with a marginal 3:1 setup. In addition, while most offer resolutions in the 3+ megapixel range, the 620 is a 2.1 megapixel camera.

2060,12917,"The inexpensive JBL HLS-610's were true audiophile quality speakers that could 'hold their own' with speakers 3 or 4 times the price! I was lucky enough to buy a pair years ago before they were discontinued. These speakers got rave reviews by the audio press and blogs, and given their low price, could have greatly cut into JBL's profit margins. Word had gotten around about these gems, and naturally JBL did not want these inexpensive but regal sounding speakers to curtail sales of their more expensive line. These timbrally accurate non-fatiguing speakers had a fantastic, detailed and warm midrange, accurate and clear highs, and fairly punchy and crisp bass reproduction.  Imaging and soundstage were incredible too. All in all, a VERY balanced and satisfying speaker that could easily compete with other expensive high end bookshelf speakers.

While the bottom  does get warm, placed on a magazine or tablecloth, there is no problem.  For me, this player finally puts DVD clearly above laserdisc.

966,12967,"Well, after reading quite a few of the one hundred or so reviews on this page, I've come to a few conclusions. Number one: If you have the money... BUY THIS UNIT! Number two, the three major problems (Low battery life,  Overheating, and bad sound) are actually only one problem; Battery life is  solved by the many adapters that are now out there, and bad sound is easily  solved by a pair of headphones. Now, as to the overheating... ever walk  into an electronics store? I have. Ever see one of these things on display?  Do you think they stop it every two hours or so and let it cool down? NO! I  walked up to one as a movie was ending on the screen, and felt the bottom  and yes, it was a little warm, but this was hardly the scalding hot surface  that some people complain of. Before you buy one of these, try to see one  up close, I promise you that you'll fall in love instantly. The crystal  sharp screen, the sleak small remote, the easy to work controls.

DVD players on laptops are nowhere near this quality, and the other  units out there (though they have larger screens) are no way close to the  quality of this unit (the Sharp and Pioneer are even more expensive!

It it very easy to use and the input option is great so instaed of buying a handheld tv you can just buy a receiver for a fifth of the cost and hook it into the player to watch tv on the go. The speakers deliver great sound for their small size but do get sqeaky at higher volumes. The virtual surround sound works perfectly.

I have experience with cameras for 50 years,  and I know the technical stuff pretty well.  This camera has the  flexibility of a good SLR with a 35-105 zoom.  I bought a cheaper Olympus  without an optical zoom first. That camera was fun for a beginner, but a  true optical zoom makes this a dream of a machine. Put a lens cap saver on,  tuck the camera into a small waistpouch, and enjoy a quality camera with  great portability.  I take it everywhere.  Also, get an AC adaptor and  battery charger.

3287,13028,"I bought the C2000 over the summer, and Olympus enclosed a mail-in certificate for free NiMH batteries and charger. The NiMH batteries largely fixed the battery problem (before, I had to carry a pile of spare  alkakines). I'm not sure how Olympus's folks signed off on some strangeness  in the mechanical design (wayward lens cap, oddly-placed strap attachment  things, power switch / shutter button placement). Also, the Flashpath  (floppy) adapter is a major pain to use. The PCMCIA adapter is simpler and  works better. A PCMCIA reader for a desktop PC/MAC is cheap. An included  case would have been nice. Olympus sells one for this camera, but no one  ever has it in stock. I don't even know what it looks like.Having said  that, I'm very pleased with picture quality and ease of use.

The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.

The only thing that i remember about this player is that it didn't have a lot of formats that it can play.  For movies all you are stuck with are dvds.  NO VCD, no dvd-r nor dvd+r.  All it does is play dvds and the cd sound is moderate.  I've never used the HDcd option so i can't say for sure.This year, I'm starting to notice that it is starting to show its wear but that is ok because it has exceeded my expectations already.  I would say that it gives error messages 1 out of every 10 movies that I load up and it seems to get worst each month.  The dual tray isn't used anymore because it has too many moving parts.  Most new players gives you 1 or 5 trays but nothing in between.  Even I knew from the start that the trays were problematic since it sometimes doen'st switch to other dvds but i never knew if that was the player or the dvd itself.This year, it has been pushed back from the living room to just a sleeping room due to other players with better format and options.

Sometimes it only made a humming sound, and I'd have to unplug it, wait, replug it in and try again.  Sometimes I had to restart my mac to get it to work.  Sometimes I was able to get through several disks in a row without any trouble.  So it was temperamental, and that's why the 4 star rating.

Most of the photos were jpegs, and they transferred just fine.  I was able to put them right in iPhoto with no trouble.  Most of the docs were created in Word '95, and Apple doesn't support that anymore.  Google Drive can read just about anything.  So I moved the docs from the floppy drive to folders in Google Drive on my mac, and they opened just fine.  Some of the formatting didn't transition so well with old resumes, but I don't care about that.  All in all there were only about 2 or 3 documents I was never able to open, and I was OK with that.  I consider this project a long-overdue success.",a very helpful gadget,"1,4"

However, and old timer like me has many files still on floppy discs, both 3.5 inch and a few 5 1/4 inch. That got me to thinking about what I could do about them. I have an OLD FDD/multi-card reader that the card reader works with Windows 7 64-bit but the FDD won't. So I searched Amazon and came across the Sabrent. I read the customer ratings,as I always do, and saw that many people said it worked with their Windows 7 and even Windows 8. So I ordered it, received it, plugged it in and within a few seconds Windows 7 64-bit said it was ready for use. I popped in a FD and heard the old familiar whirring noise. I double-clicked on Computer and there it was! I double-clicked on it and heard the drive reading the disk and saw my files display.How weird the young ones would have probably thought if they'd seen my face when it worked.Now I don't have to worry about the hundreds of floppy discs that I have not been able to read for the last few years.I haven't tried it with the low-density discs as I don't think I have any.

I wasn't expecting much for the money I invested, but I was most definately surprised at the quality and value I recieved.

I did have fun talking to other guests, though.  My next trip was to the mountains. Here, they proved invaluable. Noone else  was apparently using FRS in the area when we were there, and it was  excellent for confirming rendezvous times and places. The range is superb.  Somewhat surprising. My voice, and the person I am talking to can easily be  heard sometimes up to a mile away over hill, dale, and wadi. The features  are easy to use. My 5 year old has no problem using it (no, he dosen't go  out alone). The page feature is good to have, as well.

I tried again numerous times, and I even called Advent Customer Support to see if I was missing something.

My entire set-up cost less than 1500 dollars (includes: amp, 6 cd changer, dvd player and 2 boston acoustic floor speakers).I purchased the AW810 unit to play light jazz or rock (I'm over 30 -- ouch!), out on my deck.  I thought it would help take the edge off the day (the music, along with an extra dry martini).

1022,13724,"After reading a number of other reviews here I had considerable trepidation about this speaker's quality, but for under $30 I was willing to gamble a bit. It turns out to work well for me with very good though not spectacular sound.Again, based on other reviews, I had already decided to avoid using the provided power supply and run it on batteries (and for my poolside application this is no real burden). I note, however, that while the speaker itself runs on 12v DC the power supply I received prominently displays an output voltage of 18v(!). If this is typical then it's little wonder so many other people report hooking up and having their speaker run for only 30 seconds before going silent. With a 50% over voltage condition nobody should be surprised at circuits burning out.Overall, my impression is that the system is built to a price point and cuts corners every way possible. Expectations should be set accordingly. However, it works and seems to work pretty well (save for the glaring power supply problem) and I'm quite satisfied with the result.","Decent product, with a serious catch",1

If anyone's disappointed with the quality of the video (see reviews below), they are probably being  unrealistic in their expectations. To get better video, you'd have to go up  to a 3CCD camera (at about 3times the cost!). As for those who say that the  camera is too big and heavy, I say just TRY shooting a still video without  a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book! You NEED something  larger to get a good steady picture (even with &quot;steadyshot&quot;). I  appreciate Sony's innovative digital 8 because the tapes are less  expensive, but you still have the quality of digital recording (the Pauses  are terrific!). I'm not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable  with the mini-DV format. I mean, how often would I want to trade digital  tapes with someone? I also have the option of playing back any old 8 or  hi-8 videotapes that were previously recorded, and converting them to  digital (try THAT with a mini-DV camcorder)! I like having A/V outputs AND  inputs so that I can digitally record from a source other than the camera  lens. The Sony infrared &quot;nightshot&quot; is astounding. It's like have  nightvision goggles for your camcorder! The LCD screen on the TRV310 is  WONDERFUL... 3.5 inches! The 20X optical zoom is sufficient, and going  partway into the digital zoom ain't too bad either (as long as you don't  try to actually use the full 360X!) I cannot say enough good things at this  point. If I have to find something negative to say, I wish some of the  controls were in easier locations to get to while I'm still filming.

With a whole host of new camera effects, a zoo of fades, excellent title and credit control, and very controllable multiple audio tracks, it's possible to do quite a bit of movie editing, without paying a dime more for software.

No more tape dropouts! I videotaped  an entire season of High School football on the same 2 tapes (9 games) and  even after 9 re-cycles, there was not a single dropout or tape error.  Amazing! The image is equivalent to mini-DV (the main varaible being the  type of lenses that the cameras may use) and it has been totally reliable  under many different conditions.  On the downside, there is no manual  white balance and no manual volume control for the audio. If Sony had  included these 2 features I would have given this camera a 5 star rating.  Also, the LCD screen is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to use  outdoors in bright sunlight. (This is a problem with all camcorder LCD  screens and not just this one).

The FM stereo sound through headphones is superb.  I recommend this nifty receiver when you want to listen to local AM or FM. Finding a SW station on the puny, inaccurate frequency scales is excruciatingly difficult.  This receiver may pull in the station you're looking for, but you's need Great Caesar's Ghost to help you find it on the dial.

3362,13820,"The Grundig Mini 100PE is a surprising little radio. Now, it's certainly not a professional-grade all-encompassing shortwave set, but I doubt anyone would really expect it to be at such a small size and price. It is however, a fun little radio in a pocket sized package. The old-school tuner is somewhat touchy yet still altogether functional. The FM stereo reception is remarkably good when using earbud phones, and the included ones aren't bad. The small speaker sounds, well, like a small speaker, but again, not too bad considering its diminutive size. The little leather pouch adds a nice touch of class, and it's refreshing to find batteries included in this day and age. If you wanted to try out world band radio, or introduce a young person to it this M100 PE would be a painless place to start. Some complaints have been made about weak reception, but here in the middle of Michigan (out in \the boonies\) I can clearly pull in even weak broadcast-strength community radio stations from 60 miles away in the middle of the day (...and Radio Marti and Vatican Radio on the shortwave band). You would have to be unrealistic to expect much more at this size and cost; it's a neat little unit.","Handy, Dandy, and Economically \Sound\ !","1,3"
1029,13831,"My Grundig 300PE was a Christmas gift, 2009. One week later, it wouldn't turn on.(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW... MY FULL REVISION AND EXPLANATION IS FOUND BELOW, UNDER THE ASTRIX ...)I've installed new batteries and it won't work on the external power source either. The \light\ works, but nothing else will power up.This is frustrating, and sadly Grundig when it was a product made in Germany, was an outstanding line of radios. Now that they are made in China, there is no reliability in the products.I'd suggest \buy at your own risk\ and understand that this radio has a short shelf-life.The audio quality (while typical for a radio having a speaker this small) was GOOD. It had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area, miles away from FM transmitters. My old Sony portable radio (which I purchased and took to Russia in 1989 in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the USA) finally died after 20 years. The Grundig (when it worked) never performed as well as my Sony (made in Japan)but I wasn't too disappointed with the performance of Shortwave listening on this tiny radio. The Sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the Grundig and the Sony had vastly superior audio, despite having a speaker about the same size as the Grundig.******* UPDATE.  This Grundig radio EASILY \dies\ often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days. I thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and I was about to shoot a video to post on YouTube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it \died.\  However, I have been able to get this radio to working again (on several occasions) by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own, that there is a very VERY tiny reset button under the batteries. It has to be reset with a toothpick or a paper clip. When I reset the radio, it's like it comes back from the dead and works. But that being said, resetting this little monster is a frequent chore.","Xmas present, poops out but can be \reset\ to work again",2

The tuner quality is good ( although you can only tune down to a 5kh increment). Much better quality than the G2000a.  The sound is a bit brassy but clear. Its a good little travel radio and for the casual user its certainly worth the money .I would rate this better than its competitor the Sangean ATS 404 . It has a little bit of a better tuner , better at noise reduction and it has an external ant. jack which is always a plus . Not the best radio for DXers because of the 5kh increment but you can still get some fairly decent results .

1031,13841,"The hardware functions well. The TV viewing software works well.  The Video editing software, Studio PCTV is more than a little difficult to install. Once it is installed, it is unreliable. One needs only to visit the manufacturer's web site,......, and look at the tech assist section to get a taste of what to expect. Mainly the user will need to be able to download an uninstaller program( to use after each install attempt to clear the registry because the uninstall feature doesn't work completely), and an upgrade to the supplied program. These downloads will help, but will still not make the program trouble free. Expect system lock ups, fatal errors etc.  These problems seem to exist for any processor/windows combination. All drivers associated with video card, and sound if they are more than a year or so old wil likely need upgrading.  These comments apply to the video editing program.  There are other video editors available for use some free, some expensive and some in the middle. These will work. Some are recommended by frustrated customers on the above mentioned Mfr's web site.

The choice came down to these two after searching through all the other cards out there.What is the difference? They both use the same chip base, the BT878A. But the Voodoo doesn't have drivers for Windows 2000 and the voodoo is twice as expensive with a retail price of $99.Since I use Windows 2000 and the voodoo is not Win2K compatible, I decided to get the PCTV. The card installed without any trouble, and after installing drivers and rebooting I was watching my favorite TV channels. It took only 15 minutes total. For only $41, the card has amazing performance. It is inexpensive, but it's definately not a cheap piece of hardware! What else would you expect from Pinnacle? After all, they make professional level video editing hardware. This is their field.However, the video editing software that comes with the card is not too amazing, imho it is best to only install the drivers and the PCTV Vision from the CD.

I like Panasonic  products but I wouldn't buy another one of their DVD players for this  reason.  I bought one other for a Christmas present (at the same time I  purchased mine) and it has the same issues.

Did Panasonic change something in their manufacturing in  September? I have had no problems with any DVD's or CD's. This includes all  movies from Alien to Saving Private Ryan DTS. Once in a while a movie will  freeze for about 1/2 a second and then continue without problem. Usually I  ask someone if they noticed it and then forget about it.

I have played over 30 Dolby Digital 5.1 DVDs (mostly rented)and did not find a single glitch either in picture or audio. There was no lip sync problem either. The picture quality is great (I have a Sony WEGA, which also makes a difference!). As far as audio is concerned, it plays regular audio CD perfectly (almost). However compared to 525, it is slightly behind in &quot;crispness&quot; of the sound. I have the player hooked to a Yamaha Dolby Digital receiver via an optical cable (Monster)and the S-Video goes straight into the WEGA. The disc loading time is also very small which is nice.You don't have to wait for ages to get the disc loaded. One aspect of A120 which I did not like is that you cannot change the audio/video settings while you are playing the disc.

2119,14014,"After hours of research online, I decided to trade in my JVC XV511 DVD player for this one.  Of course, I read about the lip-sync issue, but I also found out that Sony has corrected the problem with a firmware update,  and models currently at the store already have this update.  It was evident  from reviews that apart from the lip-sync issue, the player was blowing  everyone away.  Now, I have to add my voice to that chorus -- this product  is amazing.  Though the JVC had a great picture, the Sony's is absolutely  stunning.  With a component video connection, I see no flicker in fine edge  detail, and the colors are so rich they leap off the screen.  Setting up  the 5.1 speaker output was easy, with an intuitive graphical interface.  The remote is similarly intuitive, although it took me a few minutes to get  used to the navigation button and jog wheel.  The player feels solid, discs  load very quickly, regular CDs sound excellent, and Sony has packed in a  dozen small bonuses (like being able to save a favorite frame as the  player's default display when not playing) -- all of which leaves me very  satisfied, even amazed.  With the lip-sync issue now resolved, and unless  you want to spend twice as much money, you can't do better than this  player.","Elegant engineering, great video and audio",1
3381,14019,"I asked around to some friends before buying a DVD, and was recommended the 550D multiple times. the higher end models only give you changer control (multiple dvd's/cd's) but since i already have a cd changer, i  didn't need to pay for that functionality. I have never had any issues with  audio track and video track being out of sync, in fact it has worked  perfectly. the remote control is intuitive, with multiple rewind and ff  speeds. The slow motion also has multiple speeds, so you can go frame by  frame with the jog function, or the system can move forward very very  slowly front or back. full features, digital menus, most of the controls  can also be done from the console of th machine itself. I play cd's in it  all the time as well. Optical jacks and svid and coax, really offer  flexibility when connecting to your stereo system.  I especially like the  built in dts decoding and dolby digital outputs. Very nice system!",Excellent DVD player for the price - great feature set/remot,1
3382,14027,"I definately agree that the 550 is the best for the money. One small problem that I didn't notice too many people wrote about. I cannot play audio CD's that I have burned. They play in my car's CD player, they play  in a regular CD player, in a portable sony disc man, even in a crappy, old  RCA DVD player with DIVX but not in this expensive sony? Why is that? Is it  an oversight by sony or do they want us to go out and buy one of their cd  players? I figure I already have the fiber optics hooked up to the dvd  player, why not use that&gt; Also, I disagree with others about regular  (non-CD-R) audio cd's. I think the 550 does a great job playing them. All  in all, I would definately recommend this player to anyone in the market,  unless you like mp3's off the net and you want to make your own cd's. I  would look for a DVD player that also reads CD-R's. They're out there.

3383,14028,My story is just as others have mentioned. I have always had good luck with Sony products but this one is junk. I was a little bit luckier as mine has lasted almost 2 years.

1051,14032,"My chief disappointment with this unit was that there is no volume control on the 5.1 analog outs.  This forced me to buy an outboard decoder instead of being able to connect the player directly to my power amp.

3385,14037,"This unit is built like a tank. All copper-plated massive chassis with the cool Star-Trek motorized  drop-down front door. Silly? It seems to have kept the innards perfectly clean and its playing like a champ after what?- almost 15 years. And the sound...The CD rendition is absolutely the best ever in my system- hands down and  the Sony hangs in there with the Krell (going on memory here). I&#8217;m listening to my favorite bassist Brian Bromberg (often heard him solo in small rooms) and thinking of my own acoustic bass as a comparison and, man, this player gets it! The size of the instrument, the woody little overtones, hands on the strings &#8211; it&#8217;s all there and the octave-to-octave balance is superb, neither warm nor steely. On vocals the singer sounds maybe a bit recessed, image-wise, but the presentation is so smooth it makes for overall great reproduction.Video is not up to the level of my previous Pioneer Elite player, but that isn&#8217;t the main issue around here. Also deserving of mention is that the headphone output is very sweet.  These players are a great deal if you're prepared for the whole &#34;vintage&#34; gear thing. Keep in mind that this unit is likely to be un-repairable at practical prices, so purchase wisely. I'm probably going to buy another and seal it up for the day this one dies.",Exquisite music transport,1
1052,14040,After reading the other reviews I had to look to see if I really had the same unit... I do! Possibly some people don't have very good audio equipment and down rate the player.

Picked up the DVP-S7700 used in great condition here from an Amazon reseller for $40 bucks. All functions operate smoothly. Sound rivals or perhaps exceeds PS Audio and Proceed separates and other esoterica I've had in the past. For my older ears, it *seems* like about the best player I've had - wish I could A/B with those former players. SACD playback for the few I have is just a bonus and I don't mind the analog outs a bit.

Therefore, I was amazed that some people actually had a problem with this player as posted in some of the other reviews.  I, for one, found the sound quality to be excellent.  Incidentally, of all the professional reviews I read on the S7700, never once did I see a review mention that the sound quality of this unit was only fair.  Articles I have read have also compared this player to a top-of-the-line cd player.  And I agree with them.  After installing my player, I can honestly say my cds sounded better.  This has me convinced that not all cd players sound the same.  My only thought for people who are having sound problems is perhaps they should have a home theater technician look into their setup.  Maybe all that is needed is a small adjustment and then they will know what the rest of us are talking about when we marvel about how great a DVD player this is.

There is no way to even understand some of the Rio500 features  from the material shipped, or from their web site. Although eMail questions  are answered in about 24 hours, after a week of ongoing frustration I  discovered MusicMatch. I tried Real Jukebox, but suggest downloading the  free version of MusicMatch software from MusicMatch.com to use for  downloading files and for ripping CDs for use with the Rio500.  I found it  to work intuitively and easly almost from the beginning.  You will also  need to down load the free plug in from MusicMatch to enable downloading to  the Rio device. After installing Jukebox, then go to the Jukebox tab on the  website, then to plugins.

But the Rio 600 and 800 don't have that on them. I guess that is the reason that the Rio 600 and 800 broke out of the box. But the Rio 500 is the best for me now. I got 128 MB with a 64 MB smart card. The card works great just put it in and format. A lot better than those backpacks that the Rio 600 and 800 takes. $100 Bucks for a 32 MB backpack!

It goes everywhere I go, and is so easy to lose into my pocket. {That's a good thing, it fits!} It has 64 built in memory, which is great, and can take up to 2 more extrenal memory cards, which makes it greater. The only thing that makes it less valuable is that the external and internal memories are counted as seperate storage areas, meaning you can't have half a song on each one. This makes sense since you can easily remove the memory card at any given time.This thing is also very durable. I've dropped it on rocks, cement, and even stepped on it and have never had any change in the playing quality. I have, however cracked the LCD while running and hitting the ground at 30mph, but I think anything would break like that.This product also incudes a random mode, program list, and some other options to make the sound quality better.

It's very easy to use, and you can take it anywhere.It's worth repeating: Do not use the Rio software.  As the other reviews  indicate, the software is hard to use and tends to &quot;freeze&quot; when  communicating with the device.  This is not really a problem though, since  you can download RealJukebox for free and it works GREAT.The included  headphones are so bad that I thought my player didn't work right.  With a  decent pair of Sony street style headphones, the sound is wonderful - at  least as good as any portable CD player.

There were some very important functions that I  didn't even know about for about a month after I bought it, until I finally  found someone else on the net who was able to help me.  If you have a  Macintosh computer, then I would recomend this player to you over the other  players available for Mac OS because of the functions and the ease of use  after you get past the instruction problem, but I would not recomend buying  this if you don't know anybody else who owns one who can help you learn how  to use it.

This is a major flaw, because I have some really nice tapes that I was unable to listen to.  There are ways to get around this  problem though. I highly reccomend that you duct tape the rio to a good old  sony walkman, and groove out that way.  This also allows you to look more  down to earth, rather than have people get MP3envy over your compact  MP3equipment.  (Don't try sticking the rio inside of your walkman and  closing the walkman's door- it will break the tape spindles of your  walkman).64 megs is better than a 60 minutes tape, but you can't flip  the chip.","Doesn't have auto reverse, or dolby noise reduction.","2,3"

3395,14124,"There are a lot of upsides and a lot of downsides to this product.  First thing that I need to say though, is that they have updated one very important aspect of the Rio 500.  There is now availability to use a 64 MB  SmartMedia card which makes a huge amount of difference when comparing this  mp3 player to others out in the market.I originally bought a 64 MB  card when my Rio arrived, and it did not work.  But, after emailing  Diamond/S3, they promptly (1-2 weeks, not bad considering they had to  update the firmware) corrected the problem, and now the 500 works great.  I  can fit nearly 30 songs at the 128 k/sec rate.  It's about 2-3 hours of  quality play, depending on your rate preferences.The controls on the  unit itself are excellent in my opinion.  It is true that they are not (at  all) well described in the putrid manual.  We really can't refer to it as a  manual, more like a tiny folded poster.  The blue backlit screen is really  great.  Also, the text is clear and neat looking.  Many people say they  wish the Rio 500 had the circular play/pause/stop/ff/rew controller, but I  think it's fine the way it is.  I suppose it's up to you.  But the unit is  light, slick, and very nice in general.The sound quality, as with all  Rios, is pretty much as good as it gets for mp3 players.  Get good  headphones though, as it is true that the ones they provide just don't cut  it.  Besides just the headphones issue is the small problem that the volume  level 20 (the loudest) is not as loud as one may like it to be.  But  considering what many people need the Rio for, it's understandable that it  doesn't break any records for loudness.  It really isn't that  necessary.Here come some problems... The software really is horrible.  It's just not as good as many other options.  But since those options are  generally free (MusicMatch, RealJukebox, etc), it's not really worth  worrying about.How about the transfer of data?  Well, first, a good  thing is that the Rio 500 uses USB connection, which allows for the  transfer of a song in mere seconds.  However, beware, because if the  battery is low when you transfer, you could damage the Rio.  Word is,  however, that they now have a utility for fixing this problem if it  happens.  Better than the old plan of sending the customer a refurbished  one.WMA.  I have heard that this format is going to be better than mp3,  but the 500 does not support it... yet.  Hopefully, they will upgrade the  firmware some day to support it, but as of now, they aren't.Last of all,  what about the Rio 600 and soon to come Rio 800?  Well, the 600 comes with  only 32 MB of RAM and costs less.  But how much will it cost to get it up  to 128 MB?  I'm not sure.  I think that if you can get a good deal on a 64  MB SmartMedia Card, the 500 is quite enough with the 128 MB, at least until  the next generation of players which will store songs in the GB range.  The  price of the 500 will likely go down with the 600 here, so it isn't the rip  off it once was.  The 600 has different colored face plates, but how  important is that?  Depends on what you want from the Rio.  The 600 is a  tiny bit lighter than the 500, but that is not even negotiable (about .2  oz.).So, overall, I think the 500 is a great product.  When it's  working well, it's completely awesome.  If they upgrade the firmware to  support WMA, the 500 would become even more flexible.  And with the  availability of 128 MB of RAM, it can boast space that many other mp3  players can't.  (Keep in mind that the largest SmartMedia card available  now is 64 MB, leaving the no-flash memory players at a 64 MB maximum.)  It's cool, and it does the job.  And from what I have seen, Diamond/S3 has  a decent support staff.  If you want a nice mp3 player that will last a  while, or at least until the amount of memory doesn't matter anymore, this  is a great choice.",Great product (NOTE:  It can get up to 128 MB of RAM),"1,3,4"
1061,14128,I've had this MP3 player since probably year 2000 and it STILL works surprisingly. Four years and it still works! I had a few problems...when I upgraded my PC to Windows XP. The drivers didn't support it so I had to search around and finally found RealOne had the Rio500 support.

I e-mailed for support and i explained my problem. 2 days later, i got a mail back saying that i could send my rio to them and they would replace it...3 weeks later i had my new player.

3397,14144,"Despite what others have said about this mp3 player, my view is totally the opposite. I am a senior in high school and, with one of these players, you will have a very good day. At first the software seemed quirky and i  had to reboot every now and then to get the USB to work. After I did some  &quot;spring cleaning&quot; to my computer and put a fresh version of  windows on the HardDrive it now works without any flaws. Also the software  seems to be a pain because it attempts to add every mp3 it can find on the  main harddrive to the library and then it selects every mp3 in the library,  so when you go to send files to the rio500 you have to deselect every file  you don't want. Or delete the mp3's one at a time from the library. There  is no deselect all and the delete and backspace buttons don't do the job.  If you are lucky enough to have a &quot;Drop down menu&quot; button on your  keyboard you can remove files rapidly. No compliants about the player  whatsoever. Documentation was very very poor for the player itself. They  didn't come right out and tell you that you can press IN on the scroll  button to select accessory menu command such as backlight. I figured this  one out on my own. I've had no problems with battery life mainly due to the  fact that I can get slightly used batterys for free.",The rio500 is an excellent product,"1,3,4"
1063,14145,"I owned the first Rio PMP 300 and it was novel. It was enough to get me interested in a website called Audible.com (now a direct link from Amazon.com under the talking books section). To make a long story short, when the Rio 500 came out earlier in the year I simply had to own one. It holds up to 26 hours of audio for audio books. That means you can get up to 4 whole books in the unit at once! Unabridged books, if they are short. If you are a &quot;books on tape&quot; person, you should look at the Rio's Audible Manager software that comes with it and you should check out Audible.com's 14,000 titles (again, a direct link from Amazon.com's talking books). When I commute, I don't have to fumble with tapes and I can listen to my books. I can also have them on airplanes and in hotel rooms.

It was like whoa I can download any song in the world and take it with me every where more like 20 songs. 3 years later I accidently downloaded a corruped MP3 and put it on my rio. I tryed to delete it but it just stayed on. So i downloaded the software to fotmatt the whole thing and upgraded the OS. When I was done boom. It had a black screen everytime I turned it on and would not stop. The only way was too download more software too get rid of the black screen. It worked. Then it came back. I ran the software again and It did not work again again and again. My computer froze everytime because once it restarted the rio it was waiting for a resonce. Because it did not work it never got a responce. So I ignored it thinking it will go away some day. I turned it on then it still had it. I contaced rio and then they said WE DO NOT SUPPORT THAT MP3 PLAYER ANY MORE. SO I never got it repired. Now took it apart and had fun torchering it.

3400,14170,"This is a great product.  Sound output is just as good as a CD player.  After spending time researching, I found that this was the only mp3 player that could support over 64MB of memory, which is an advantage over other  mp3 players because you don't have to constantly switch fragile memory  cards to get another hour of music.  With updates that can be downloaded  from diamond's website, the rio500 can now support 64MB of external memory,  so the player can have a total of 128MB of memory, which is more than  anything out there.  (The flash-ROM is useful in quickly and easily  updating the rio).  I had no problems installing the software.  And  downloading songs to the player is incredibly fast.  With a download rate  of 0.5MB per second, it takes just 4 minutes to fill 128MB of memory.  The  built-in equilizer is useful in boosting bass and treble.  The adjustable  backlight it very bright.  It also includes random and repeat play modes,  as well as some other progroming functions.  A bookmark feature is useful  for listening to books.  My only complaint is that the software is  confusing to use at first.  Oh, and also buy better headphones along with  the Rio, since the earbuds it comes with are basically junk. With its tiny  size, sleek design, and good quality, it's well worth the $200 pricetag.",The best out there,"1,3"
3401,14174,"My opinion is that the Rio player, along with most MP3 players, lack features that other types of players are capable of. One of these features that it lacks is that Rio has a lot of memory for a MP3 player these days,  and it can only play 2 HOURS of songs with its onboard memory. After that,  its $100 for a 1 hour (32mb) flash card. With CD's and MD's, the hour is  for about $3. Also, there are not many different models to choose from,  whoch is a drawback. There is also the problem of BATTERIES. Now, I have a  suckie CD player, so I only get 6 hours every 2 batteries, but some CD  players can accomnplish 50+ hours of CD playing on 2 batteries. 12 hrs/1  battery is pretty much outragous (thats why I need a new CD player).

This is a serious computer, it has fully functional Word and Excel programs and it will synchronize with a PC using Outlook, meaning you can keep appointments, phone numbers, in fact anything at all on both computers. It has a lot of neat little programs built in, so you can tell it your home city and it will tell you the time there, including when to expect sunrise and sunset, and you can then use the pen thing to select any other city in the world. The Psion will tell you how far away that city is in miles, kilometers and nautical miles, what time it is there, what the local sunset and sunrise times are and what area codes you should use should you want to call someone in that city. You can also program the Psion using the EPOC language, a variant on Basic, you can store drawings which you can then put onto your PC, in fact it can do pretty much anything a normal portable can do. You can also record conversations and music, print stuff out directly or through your PC and cruise the internet and do email if you buy the nice little travel modem.

You can feel the rumble of thunder like the real thing, or a bomb exploding, and glass shattering everywhere like its at your feet!!!  The only downside of it is that one tape player stopped working after about 2 1/2 years, and the other one just last month, Jan 05. 5 years is pretty good for a tape player I think.

1074,14289,I got this system for christmas and it was the best present ever. It was EZ to set up. It has so many features on it like kareokee (?) and even a game. But the best part of this system is the bass. It has turned my old  CDS into great CDs and its got BBE which enhances high pitched stuff. The  tuner is great after you set up the FM radio antenna (?). I haven't tried  out the AM radio yet but nobody listens to that. Its so easy to get any  radio station; you just set a # for a station and press that # to go to it.  CHA-CHING! I have 18 station presets. The tape works fine and it records  stuff on tape fine. Theres a timer which wakes me up to the Beastie Boys  every school day. Also the display is awesome! The only thing about this  system is that its 200 fricking watts which is enough to blow out all your  windows man! I listen to it on 10 of 50 and its sooooo loud. Bt thats coo'.

The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&amp;W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well.

I love  the idea of not having to use any cables or &quot;special&quot; programs to  download my pics.  I will say though, I have gotten quite a few pics. that  were of poor quality (fuzzy) and then out of the blue...picture perfect.  I  use a photo program I bought from Walmart for $10, EZPhoto (I used it when  I scanned my &quot;old&quot; paper photos) and I normally reduce the size  of my picture A LOT to send quicker through emails.  This camera does have  an email feature though. Quite a few people said that you don't get a very  good quality pic. for printing, but I have to say I disagree.  Maybe the  printer they are using is of poor quality.  I have printed hundreds of  pics. and everyone has enjoyed them and are so surprised they came from a  print off from the digital camera.  One thing that disappointed me about  this camera is...for the $ you spend, you don't get a carrying case.  I  bought a cheap &quot;purse&quot; that looks like a camera case and has many  compartments to carry all the extras (battery charger etc.). I spent $6 on  it and it was well worth more than that.  You can't tell it's even a purse.  Another thing, I checked all over..stores and internet and the price of  this camera does not really vary...and if  there's a substantial difference in pricing somewhere..CHECK TO BE SURE  YOU'RE GETTING THE BATTERY CHARGER WITH IT!

Holding in the stop key allows one to see how  much recording time is left.  The erase button is indented to avoid  accidents, and the user is prompted to confirm any erasures with a second  press.Voice quality is great in 33 minute mode.

In 90 min mode,  however, a deep voice is hard to make out clearly (I agree with the  reviewer below:  a 60 min. mode would have been a good compromise).I've used mine daily for 3 months to make brief notes.

I could understand myself, especially if I spoke right into the microphone, but it was tedious listening. The 33 minute mode sounded just fine.I really like the voice activated recording. It turns off after 1 second of silence and reactivates instantly. It never cut off the beginning of a sentence - very nifty. This results in your 33 minutes capturing quite a bit of information since silent spots are 1 second max.Use the &quot;Hold&quot; button to avoid the problems some of the reviewers have mentioned about accidental recording.

2137,14378,"I have found that the Energizer 2500mAH NiMH batteries are worthwhile to buy - they last much longer than any other rechargeable I've ever used, even with extensive flash use.I've had my camera for over 3 years, and it serves well for everything from internet pics to post & e-mail photos to send, to high resolution 5X7\ and even some 8X10\ respectable quality prints.On the other hand, the major failure of this camera lies in a poorly designed and cheaply built battery door.  Nikon's chief battery door designer was apparently sick that day, and the janitor obviously submitted the design they used.  Eventually, even if you're careful, the chintzy little lightweight plastic slots on the camera body that the battery door tabs lock into, will break, and your otherwise finely made and great performing camera will need a generous strip of ducttape to hold the door closed - this makes the necessity of using the highest capacity NiMH battery you can find all that more important.  I'm drawing up plans to fabricate some small metal tabs to embed into the camera body to replace the crappy broken plastic, but haven't yet gotten happy with the Dremel tool to do the work.Bottom line:  Be Careful when you open the battery door - press it down against the camera body before you slide it to the unlocked or open position, and you can delay the inevitable plastic tab failure that will ruin an otherwise outstanding camera.","It's as good as everyone has already mentioned, BUT...",5

The whole camera  was rather intuitive and I was thrilled with the ease of downloading the  pictures to my G4.  We had also purchased a USB Film reader with the  camera.  We were surprized by how quickly the batteries ran out (about 1.5  hours of use) but have quickly ordered rechargable batteries.  This I can  see as the only downside of taking this camera on a long trip.  We now have  to pack a battery charger and always kep an extra set of batteries on us.

2139,14420,"I own the 950 since the first days when it was launched. Since it is a product with many reviews, I will perhaps focus on a few positive and negative aspects I have found over this time.For positive, well, overall image quality is very good, colors are very balanced and not artificially saturated for that extra good look. I found myself doing some level adjustment sometimes, you will still need your Photoshop, but in any case, even with high-end professional models, you are likely to end up doing some digital darkroom work. The 2.11 CCD is quite good and enough to print excellent photo-quality A4 (I'm in Europe, that's about the area of a 17&quot; monitor) prints that people will mistake for normal photos (matched with a good printer of course). The firmware is very effective, but a few features have been improved in the 990, which I have used too. The swivel design ends up being VERY useful. Trust me, you will notice the difference sometimes when a normal camera wouldn't work as good.My favorite aspect has to be the absolutely AMAZING macro mode. The 950 can focus sharply at a ridiculously small distance from the subject. This thing is almost a microscope. Yes, it can be tricky to adjust lightning in those cases, but the ability to focus so well at such distances really impressed me when this model came out.So to keep it short, I'm happy when it comes to overall image quality, color accuracy, and features the main problems with this model are:-Considerable barrel distortion at wide angle. If you do a lot of architectural photos or are just unlucky and pick a tricky shot (like a door for instance) at the edges of the screen, at wide angle, well, it is way too obvious sometimes. Few digital cameras offer high-quality lens that are completely (almost) barrel distortion free, but I can't help looking at some cheap digicams using Zeiss lenses and feeling that the Coolpix deserved better. At Tele, the problem is a lot less obvious, but on wide, expect some of your lines to be more like,well...splines. -No USB interface, no Firewire, no nothing besides the plain' old serial interface. Ever tried transferring 48MB at 115k? Well, let's just say that it reminds me the days when I used analog modems. A lot of patience is required. Again, this could and should have been released with USB support (which was widely available at the time).  -Big body. The camera is a big big, not cigarrete-packet size like some Canon's and other models, so, that might end up meaning that you'll take it with you less often. -Some chromatic distortion (purple edges, etc) under certain conditions.  -Forget about using Alkalines they will last 10 minutes. Go for NiMh 1600 rechargeables. The 8MB default card will only hold about 10 photos at maximum resolution, or 1 if you don't want lossy compression. 48 MB or 64 MB cards are essential. -Panel isn't always visible under bright sunlight (newer firmware revisions have addressed this issue, but it's still tricky sometimes) -First versions of NikonView were incredibly , to the point of the user not being able to recover transferred photos after a connection failure (that meant that aborted transfers at 90% of the card when you're using a slow serial protocol meant starting all over, quite fun). Don't worry, NikonView is now a lot more solid and, but I did suffer with the first versions.Overall, a very good camera that can give you very good photos (and that means printed photos). Also, keep in mind that the final price ends up rising, since you're likely to need at least the following accessories: A Bigger CompactFlash card (48 MB or 64 MB), At least 4 NiMh 1600 batteries + a charger, and a decent caseWith Zeiss lens instead of the Nikkor 7-21mm used and USB interface, this could still be the best 2.11 on the market.

2140,14423,I just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since.  The macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment.  I do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but I figure  if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it.  I have not been  disappointed yet by the quality.  Picked up 8 rechargeable batteries and a  64 mb card and I haven't looked back since.,Holy Macro,1
3423,14438,"This camera is terrible.  The manual focus does not work at all.  Under normal light, the picture quality is acceptable, but really poor under low light.  The software included is extremely poor, and the technical support from Xirlink (the maker of the camera) is worse.

Biggest problem is that it's focus will not improve as well as the lighting  problem and both of these problems are mentioned in other reviews.  I have  a couple of other cameras that are less to purchase if price is a  consideration but both are substantially better cameras.  My favorite is  the QuickCam although mine is the parallel port version that creates a  problem for me only because I can't keep my printer and camera connected to  my PC at the same time.

3424,14445,"I recently came across the top-of-the-line sony portable minidisc recorder/player and used it for a while. my conclusions from this trial of this format are: Pros: small, lightweight, easily portable, rewritable,  easy to useCons: terrible sound quality (Sony would have you believe  that it produces perfect CD quality or better sound, but don't believe  them, minidisc is a very low bitrate, meaning that at lower recording  volumes it will sound very good, but as the recording level and frequency  range increases, it becomes more and more grainy and digital sounding), bad  interface, very expensive.I have an extremely high-end stereo system  (Mark Levinson, Krell, B&amp;W, rega) which I hooked this player up to,  using my $15,000 Mark Levinson Digital To Analog converter, and from my  $15,000 Mark Levinson CD player, made some copies, and played them back.  That is about the best quality minidisc will ever be, and it sounded  terrible, like a $50 Sony CD player. even with more than $70,000 worth of  audio equipment behind it, it still sounded vile, harsh and grainy. Another  problem with it is the digital interface it uses. they should offer coaxial  digital outputs to enhance the sound quality a little bit, it isn't a big  strech, especially because sony invented the system. they try to pass EIAJ  optical off as a viable, high-end format. All in all, I think that you  should stay with CD, even though it is large, it is not worth the huge  investment to go to minidisc. if you want a portable system, but don't care  about sound quality, go with MP3.",this sucks,"2,3,4"
2141,14447,"This is by far one of the best electronic purchases that I have ever made. This model is easy and fun to use. I bought this Mini Disc player/recorder because I needed something to listen to at work, but didn't want a tape player due to the fact that one has to stop working to flip the tape all the time. I can put a lot of music and audio books on one mini disc. It is built like a tank and I can recharge the batteries without taking the batteries out. I got the recharge batteries and A/C power adapter at Radio Shack. Recording from my stereo is a snap. I can't understand why Mini Disc players and mini discs aren't more accepted here in the U.S.A. The advantages mini discs have over CD's are huge.",Little Mini Disc Power House,1

Not only can you easily record MP3 using a mini-jack cable from the back of your sound card you can easily  record CDs using a mini-jack to rca cable if you have an older stereo, or  use the optical cable provided for perfect digital recordings. I finally  have a product with the capabilities of making a mix of CD and MP3 music on  CHEAP rewritable 74 minute media. MD media costs around 2-5 dollars a disc.  This item is so versatile I don't see why anyone doesn't buy it. My only  concern is the lack of a LCD display on the headphone remote, but I can  deal with it.

2143,14475,"I had WP1 and A1 before. Both of them looked almost the same except the colour of the rubber grip for the hand is different, the macro logo of the mode dial is different. WP1 is a weatherproof camera, not waterproof. It is excellent for snorkelling and rugged use. WP1 started to leak at 6m or 20ft when I used for SCUBA diving, that was my mistake. So I bought an A1, so far tested to 35m (though only guaranteed to a few metres) and still going strong, same for another 2 A1s that my friends have. Both WP1 and A1 are excellent cameras, gave excellent pictures. The price difference (almost 100%) basically gives you the peace of mind in terms of water-tightness. One thing to take note, the flash is not strong enough so underwater pictures will turn out to be greenish or bluish, and fine particles will tend to disperse the flash and over expose the pictures. Have fun!",Canon WP1 vs Canon SureShot A1,2
2144,14477,"It may not have all the cute features that you could want on a camera, but it makes up for it by being durable and rugged.  I just recently discovered the &quot;WP&quot; stands for weatherproof, not waterproof.  I've been taking mine into the pool and into the ocean for years without a problem, although the camera has never been deeper than a few feet under the water. It is not sufficient if you are a serious scuba person, but for the traveler or outdoor enthusiast, this camera will greatly expand your picture taking abilities.  While I have several expensive, feature-laden cameras, I often prefer to use this camera.  I find it has three advantages for me.  First, its ruggedness allows it to go places my expensive cameras cannot.  This includes the beach, on to boats, or into water.  You can throw this camera onto the sand or take it into the ocean for fun vacation shots.  Second, I'm not worried about losing this camera, as I would be of losing a more expensive camera.  Not only is it moderately priced, but also you can slip it into a bathing suit pocket and swim with it.  You don't have to leave it on a towel and worry about it as you swim.  Thirdly, it's small and lightweight.  It's not burdensome to carry-around.  For those times that you would like to get a snapshot, but you don't want to lug around a camera bag and a bunch of attachments, this camera is perfect.  And while you're carrying it, you don't have to worry about getting caught in the rain.While it may lack some features, its picture quality is surprisingly good.  If you are thinking that a waterproof disposable camera has the same advantages that I listed above (i.e., waterproof with worry-free portability), be advised there is a big difference in the quality of the prints.  I've used both and you get much better pictures from this camera. It may not do everything that a fancier camera can do (zoom, macro, etc.), but what it can do it does exceptionally well.  This camera has taken some of my favorite vacation snapshots and family pictures, if for no other reason than it was there with me when the picture opportunity presented itself while my &quot;good&quot; camera sat safely (and uselessly) packed away and protected.",This is a fantastic little camera.,1

Well, after 1.5 years of moderate use, the  record head seems to have quit on me.  I'm going to look into fixing it,  but I feel that it will be foolish to sink more money into this after it  broke in such a short time.

I gave it to a friend for maybe four or five years and just recently got it back.  It's just a stereo amp, which by today's standards is a bit weak, but it is in my room chugging away after almost a decade.

It even  has two holes at each upper corner to temporarily store the stylus for  later access.  I rated it four out of five, for the following reasons: 1)  It monopolizes the periperhal port (it would be great to attach a modem to  this particular keyboard while it is attached); 2) I would really like to  have had Home/End functionality similar to a real keyboard.

3430,14544,"For the price, I have seen few components that offer the variety of features and the quality of sound that the SL-PD8 can.  The unit is slightly bulky but very sturdy.  The single significant drawback is  somewhat inconvenient placement of some controls, particularly the Skip  button, which is difficult to reach with the drawer open.  Other than that,  the unit is very easy to use considering its impressive selection of  features.Perhaps the most unusual feature is the Spiral Play capability,  which plays the first track of each disc, then the second, the third, and  so on, delivering the variety of the more common random play mode and the  reliability of straight through play in a single function.  I find this to  be the most frequently used function in my household.The sound quality  is quite good.  Although the upper frequencies are slightly tinny and  occasionally a bit indistinct, they are more than adequate for even  classical music.  The midranges make for dynamic vocals and the low end is  most impressive.Certainly, there are better technical units out there,  but none are anywhere near this price range and, consequently, do not offer  the value of this Technics deck.

I've had everything from a low-powered joystick to a scanner plugged into  it, and haven't experience many difficulties.  The only thing that threw it  for a curve was a USB ethernet adapter, which inexplicably stopped  functioning properly after a few hours of being plugged in to the hub.  I'm  not sure why, but it had to be plugged directly into the computer's USB  port to work reliably.That anomaly aside, the only thing I can think  of that it doesn't do what its packaging says it should, is add four ports  to your system.  It adds only three, because, of course, it has to be  plugged into one of your computer's existing ports.  Indeed, every time  you add one of these puppies to your system you're only adding three more  ports, because one port always has to be used simply as a connector.Other reviewers have pointed out that it doesn't work well on Macs or  under Windows 95.  I unfortunately haven't been able to verify either of  those statements, so I'll leave my review qualified to this extent:  by and  large, it works very well under Windows 98.

If your useing the rubber ducky antenna as i have to, (no way to run wires to mount a regualr one in my convertable, not to mention limited real estate to mount it to) you have to take a piece of electric tape and place it over the antenna contact on the bottom of the radio. if you dont then its trying to put out through both the short antenna, AND the enternal antenna wire, which, and im no electronice expert, i would guess causes some kind of feed back. one little square of tape and my problem was solved. i searched all day looking for a fix online and found nothing, so i hope this helps some people.  over all i am satisfied with it, the range is short, but better for me because of the soft top (not as much metal to get in the way) but i only wanted it for short range line of sight to friends with mobiles and the occational trucker i work with on way to and from work.",midland 75-822 (and squeal fix),5

1139,15188,"Ok, the features list and the configuration make this look like a great product.  Functions as either a mobile CB with a very small footprint, or as a handheld, NOAA Weather stations, easy to use. Looks good so far. But, as a radio, it's just plain junk.Range as a handheld with the provided antenna is only around 100ft or so between two identical units, and that's with the squelch control turned off. So an external antenna is mandatory for pretty much any use.  Even when you get good reception, the audio quality from the built in speaker is flat and hard to hear.Using it while driving is the worst situation at all, since the radio is severely impacted by ignition noise from your car. Yes, this is something that you have to deal with when using just about any two-way radio, so it's not like a different brand would eliminate the problem, but this unit does not appear to have any built-in filtering to help with the issue.","Great idea, poor execution.","2,3"

2194,15195,"I purchased this CB for traveling, camping, etc.. I chose it because of the 10 Weather Channels, and another means of communications in emergencies when I an out of cell and Onstar range. I can use it in the car, RV, walking, and on my motorcycle. It is light weight, comes with 3 different power source options, a charger for the NICAD battery pack, 2 different antenna connections, a \rubber duck\ for short range use, and is generally a good multi-function utility. I do recommend you get an external/magnet mount antenna for automotive use, as the enclosed metal capsule will block signals and shorten the transmit/receive abilities. This CB will also interface with my JM Corp Integratr IV, with the proper cable (JMSR-AC17), for motorcycle/ATV use. Midland products have always performed well.Update 04/13/13:Still using this radio. The better quality antennas give it good range. Pretty much any of the better brands (Firestik, K40, and Wilson) work far superior than the supplied rubber antenna for automotive use. A cheap magnet mount is a little better, but not much.

3475,15209,"I purchased this from another site, but I wanted to clear up some misconceptions.  First, keep in mind any all-in-one models are going to have some limitations with the speaker and microphone.  That is just a small issue that I notice.Biggest thing I need to remind people is CB operates around 27 Mhz, which has a wavelength of around 36 feet.  If you are buying this hoping to get miles out of the included antenna, put your money away right now.  A short little antenna will NOT get you very good range.  All handheld antennas are designed for portability first, usefulness second.  There are some decent ones you can buy but they are still very limited by their size.If you intend to use this in a car you must buy and install an antenna in your car.  The included antenna is short enough as it is, using it inside a car will reduce your range to as little as a few feet.  Even a cheap magnet mount, properly tuned, will be an incredible improvement.  Please make sure also when plugged in to your car to keep the power to high.  This gives the full 4 watts allowed by law and 2-3 times the range as low.If you follow these guidelines this is a very versatile radio that is very rich in features for it's size.  Don't let negative reviews from people who are obviously not familiar with installing and using a CB radio dissuade you from it.

1145,15272,"I bought my Midland 75-822 for its 40 channels at AM but hoped that it culd be mod to FM and 120 channels as said in some reviwes. Actually, I would prefer AM/FM CB walkie with 40 legal channels but they are second to non-exiting. (Why ?) BEWARE as of rouhgly New Year 2011 MOD to this gadget is not known anymore. Midland has CHANGED the PCB without changing the model number, so you will not be able to MOD it anymore according to recipees on the net, and it is not clear that it will be ever possible - perhaps they have somply removed the extra functionality from the chip and/or closed all loopholes permitting inadverted MODs.As for the gadget itself, it is not extremly well done - I'd say even sloppy and the manual brashly not giving enough info to the user. For example, draw of current from batteries at CB reception is incredibly high: 63mA and at wether channel even more (with volume set to minimum). Given the current state of the art of chips I would say it is virtualy imposible to arrive to such a high power consumption. The sound quality could be better especially at low signal intensities where a kind of auto-squelch cut of the RF signal producing audible distortions in the demodulated audio. The adio amplifier is irritatingly noisy even at lowest level setting and under squelch. Also annoying is the fact that if you plug normal stereo headphones you will hear tone only in left earphone whereas the right is muted. The audiuo output to the earphone is the same as of the loudspeaker meaning too noisy at normal listening level and too loud (you must keep the volume knob at very low setting if you do not want your eardrum as well as the earphone membrane blown away). The external microphone jack is unexplained in the manual: it serves at the same time as input and Push-To-Talk control (PT) - once you plug in the micophone jack your PT button is dead. Manual is mute on whether 75-822 supports condenser mic whichy requires power supply or dynamic mic or both (or none ? - I did not try any).All in all, good value for the price, standard quality but not CB-philic one. However, I do not know of better CB walkie on the market. My recommendation: if you need something like this, buy it.",Very good but not exceptional,1

You can disconnect the radio from the cord at it's base and lock it in a console to prevent theft. I think Midland just doesn't advertise some of the features well enough - like the ability to disconnect and hide it. In about 10 seconds you can convert it to a handheld radio and go for a hike. The weather channels work well and I love the scanning feature. I also don't know why so many people complain about the antenna.

So I notified Amazon, who immediately sent me a new one, which works flawlessly.  I returned the broken unit to Amazon, postage prepaid by Amazon.  Top-notch.The radio works as expected, and although the range is not as long with the short antenna as it is when it is tied to a FireStik.  No surprise there.  But when out four-wheeling or on multi-car road trips, this is the way to go.

2206,15306,"UPDATEOK, I received a replacement radio from Midland.It took about 2 weeks for the replacement to arrive. It came in a small brown box, not the retail package that I sent it in. All the parts were piled in the box with packing peanuts. The radio and accessories were all fine, not beat up or scratched. I guess it didn't look expensive enough for UPS to bother trying to smash to pieces. The only thing wrong was the wrist strap was not in the box. I probably wouldn't have used it anyway. I put some rechargeable batteries in the battery holder and turned the radio on....and I was receiving skip, so the problem was fixed with what is probably a (refurbished) radio. Looks new though and it works. I should not have had to pay shipping to have a defective radio replaced but that's life. I like the radio!Received the radio and placed the batteries in the battery holder and turned the unit on. Did not receive any CB signals but not too suprised with the flexible antenna. Checked out the weather channels and received them fine. Took the radio out to the truck and installed the vehicle adapter and connected the radio to a Wilson 1000 antenna and flipped through all 40 CB channels....nothing but background hiss. I backed the squelch all the way off and got the same result. Connected the Cobra 75WXST back to the antenna and received skip on almost all channels. Reconnected the 75-822, checked the SWR, all channels below 2, still no CB reception. Packed the radio back in the box, called Midland, sent radio to Midland and now I will wait for a few weeks and think about the extra $10.00 it cost to own this radio due to shipping to Midland. Customer service at Midland was pleasant and spoke english. I could have sent the radio back to abetterwaytobuy but the turn around time from Midland seems to be shorter than the long wait I had the first time from abetterwaytobuy.

I will receive a Wilson Lil Wil external antenna in 2 days and will be able to comment further on its use with an external antenna. One comment however that noone else has mentioned. In order to use an external antenna, you have to use the D/c adapter that comes with the radio. You cannot connect an external antenna and use the radio on either of the 2 supplied battery packs. The mobile adapter that connects to the radio has the connection for an external antenna attached. Therefore, no mobile adapter (dc connector), no place to connect an external antenna. My reason for purchasing this unit was because I was already running so many things off of dc in my car (radar detector, GPS charger, digital scanner etc.) For the price, this radio operates the same as other radios that run off d/c that cost 1/2 the price. I ordered a Uniden pro520xl that I plan on installing in my other car.

I have this Midland model 74-200 for a home alert and I also purchased the Midland 74-250 for mobile alert info.  Both have SAME technology that you program into the radio.  Note: Initially, the programming can be thought provoking; but once this is accomplished, any weather/ emergency alert will advise you, at your command, of your specific areas in text and alert tones.  ANYTHING can happen at ANY TIME - These radios will let you know immediately.  The best manufacturer for this type of of product is Midland.

NOAA weather radio is also used in some areas for other alerts-hazardous materials spills, geologic events, and Amber Alerts.  It is evolving into an \all hazards\ radio service.Radios like the Midland 74200 silently monitor the broadcasts 24/7.  When an alert is broadcast, the radio will activate, either turning on automatically, or activating an alarm that tells you a warning is being broadcast.  You can also just listen to the broadcasts.  You'll get better weather information than you will on the TV News' Doppler StormTracker Accu-Severe Weather SWAT Command Team.Every home needs one of these radios. Think of it as a smoke alarm for the outdoors.The Midland 74200 is one of the best units available.  It has a feature called Specific Area Messaging Encoding (SAME) which allows you to program it to only receive alerts for the counties you are interested in.  This is a necessary feature - with it you won't be awakened at 2 AM for a flood alert three counties away.It's a bit of a chore to program, but the manual is very helpful.  Once it is set up, it works beautifully.  Good reception of all 7 weather radio channels. Is small and unbstrusive, and can function as an alarm clock.  The battery backup will ensure that you will be alerted if the AC power goes out.If you live where there is weather, you need one of these radios.

1167,15539,"Class D citizen band provides an excelent very short distance communication.  With the FCC only legally allowing 4 watts on 11 meters your range is very limited; all CB's can potentially be modified however for a illegal higher output.  Unless your running a half wave base antenna, a nice beam, or a extremely long hi-gain mobile antenna dont expect much from this rig, or any other CB rig.  With the new FRS fad they are pounding in the 2 mile range... however this is not true because one they run in (FM)frequency modulation mode which has excelent sound but its mainly line of sight communication only, two they have extreme power restrictions and no external antennas; those 350 miliwatts of power will barely get you a mile unless your in an excelent terrain.  I highly recomend AM mode for distance, however if your going to buy a CB get one with (SSB) single side band which will allow you to use a portion of an AM wave the upper or lower part.  In side band mode your 4 watt radio will produce 12 watts of legal power because you are only using the top, or bottom part of a wave without a carrier, this tends to be garbled so constant adjustment with the clarifier nobb may be neaded. As well on CB..11 meters if your lucky in the heat of the summer days the band accasionaly will open up and allow your radio wave to skip clear across the world; this is rare though running such low power but it is possible and ive seen it happen.  But for those who seek the distance of radio Amateur (HAM) radio is what its all about.  The FCC has made it possible to become a liscensed ham operator without knowing morse code anymore and a 35 question test which you can pass with a 70%.  As a ham operator i can tell you its very rewarding, repeaters are free to use and usually have about a 25-40 mile range which you can hit with just miliwatts of power, or for those who seek long communications it is legal to run up to 1.5 kilowatts (1500 watts) of brute power.  Although this is not neaded you can easily work the world with low power on certain bands.

The tripod itself is made of a light aluminium material for the legs, so while this reduces weight for portability it seems a little light on solidity.  The locking screws which hold the extendable legs in place also seem a little flimsly.  Having said that however, I took notice of reviews prior to purchasing the tripod and never overtighten them and accordingly they have worked okay.  Suprisingly, it doesn't take much tightening of the screws to secure the legs.  I often expect the legs to slip down but they stay in place during extended viewing sessions.  The actual mounting plate and associated adjustment knobs all work fine and are manufactured to an acceptable standard.  The tripod has a three prong metal bracket which sits in the middle of the legs when the tripod is in position and which folds up with the tripod when stored.  This bracket is quite flimsy but has not failed yet.  There is a centre tray which is screwed to the centre of the bracket to give the tripod more stability and holds eyepieces etc.  This is manufactured okay.  Overall, I think the tripod could have been made sturdier and from better materials in some areas.  However, I have taken extra care with it, so I really can't complain as mine is still in good condition. I also think the tripod is somewhat overpriced, so look out for specials on it.

We were camping in a tent in a place that had to be canoed to, so we set out on a Wednesday with all of our tents and food and gear for a week but we were unable to fit the telescope and tripod, so we left those at the car. We had to make a special trip a few days later to pick them up. It would have been really nice to be able to take the telescope with us on the first trip. We ended up missing two beautiful nights that would have provided for excellent observing because of the bulkiness of the tripod. There is another instance when I was winter camping in the Adirondacks near Little Tupper Lake, and again we had to leave the telescope and tripod at the car because of the bulkiness. We were traveling to a lean-to on skis and there was no way that we could have taken the tripod and telescope along with our luggage. We ended up not using the telescope all together on that trip because of the inaccessibility. There is no carrying case for it and so the only way to transport it safely is in its outrageously oversized shipping box, filled with a Styrofoam shell. Also, There have been many car trips in which this box has taken up way too much space in the trunk.The tripod itself is a necessity though. It would be impossible to get any good observations without it. It has a handy balancing bubble to make sure that it is level, and an &#65533;N&#65533; on one of the legs to remind you which way is north (as an amateur astronomer, finding this out through the stars should not be too difficult though), and it is sturdy. The legs are easy to extract, contract and adjust. It is the most sensible tripod to buy with any ETX telescope because the other options are way too heavy and even more bulky, not mention more expensive. There is the table tripod, which is much, much smaller and lighter, but it is way too ineffective. It is unable to be adjusted so the telescope must be placed on a desk or a steady surface. The only beneficial use of that tripod would be if the telescope were a decoration in an office or something and it needed to be tilted a bit.A tripod is needed in order to get any serious use out of any ETX telescope and this tripod is the best one that Meade offers, be forewarned that it limits the portability of the telescope though.",An adiquate tripod for great telescopes,"1,3"

One end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loop.The end with the lock can swivel, so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangled.I wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop.

Wish it had a scroll ring (innovation to substitute for scroll wheel) but it's an older model. Kensington makes the best trackballs and the newer versions have scroll rings and optical tracking. The little glass beads inside collect dust, but the ball pops out for easy cleaning.

But hang in there-- it's worth it!Rest the outside of your palm along the outer edge and let your hand sort of \cradle\ the trackball.  Notice that you can completely relax your hand without any accidental movement or button pressing.  Now THAT is the unique property that I have never found in another track ball... and believe me, I've tried them all, even all of Kensington's other models, at the ergo lab at work and at stores.  Use the primary button with your thumb and the off-button with your last 3 fingers (any combination that's comfortable).  Use your index finger on the ball.Maintenance is really quite easy.  Just pop out the ball every few weeks (or every few days, if you're an all-day-every-day user like me) and brush off the rollers & pegs with a Q-tip.  If you eat potato chips at the computer or something, you might need to clean it a little more often.

1195,15937,"There isn't a rebate now but if it pops up again, forget it. Not only will you not get a rebate, you won't get ANY customer support. Not even an automated return email. The player itself is actually pretty good in sound quality if you get your computer software to work (GOOD LUCK), albeit a bit slow in downloading mp3s. You have to download 1 song at a time. It takes my 900mhz TBird about 1 minute per song using the parallel port. About 18 minutes to load up 64MB. Just my $.02.",Forget it if you need any support.,2
2249,15939,I can't believe this company doesn't support NT or Win 2000. The lack of support for >32 MB Smart Media cards is also annoying. The manufacturer should wake up.,now windows 2000 support,2

3535,15959,"This product is great. It installs easy and then you start up your computer and there is no problem. It is fast and easy, with great dilivery and nothing to search for on the web to make it work, like downloads. If I ever need another I'm keep this in mind.",great and easy,1
2251,15977,"this card ruined my computer! its not as easy as put the card in the slot and boot it back up.the instruction book doesnt tell you that you have to remove the existing cards drivers and remove the old card from the device  manager before you shut it down remove the old card then install the new  one.it was one gigantic disaster of a day for me and my computer.this cards  tech support line is in canada and is a toll call, a $100 dollar toll call  and they were absolutly no help. if your smart DONT install this card  yourself, no matter how easy it looks, take it to compusa or your local  computer store and let them do it. i had to send my computer back to the  manufacturer for the second time because i thought i could do it myself.",Ruined My Computer,2
3536,15992,"this pci card has great picture quality (even with my 8mb video card). The sound is crisp and the software is very good. it is overloadig features. My personal favorite is that you can minimize it and it automatically sets itself as your desktop and you icons are still clear. Setup is a breeze, and you only have to connect two cables (audio and cable/antenna line). It has all th ports of a vcr (video ports for a video game and an s-video port for DVDs.) All in all, it is a great product and much cheaper than 17&quot; TV.",a great buy,1
